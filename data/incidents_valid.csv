    FOOD ALLERGIES Consumers who have a food allergy or severe food sensitivity should always
    read ingredient labels. In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing
    ingredient is in the food. 
    A food allergy occurs when the immune
    system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed. 
    Symptoms may include throat swelling,
    trouble breathing, or a rash. 
    Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food
    is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction. 
    Several foods account for 90% of allergic
    reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs,
    milk, soy, and wheat. 
    Persons who have a severe, life-threatening
    food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.",allergens,prepared dishes and snacks,soybeans and products thereof,ravioli

33,2004,3,19,na,Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water,"Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water Friday 19 March 2004 Category D: For information only Ref: 12/2004 Heads of Environmental Health Services and Directors of Trading Standards will wish to be aware of a product withdrawal by The Coca-Cola Company of their Dasani brand bottled still water. The product has been found to contain raised levels of bromate, which exceed the permitted quantity stated in the Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations 1999 as amended. The product has been on sale throughout the UK in retail outlets and from vending machines. The product recalled is: All Dasani bottled still water No other Coca Cola products are known to be affected Local authorities may wish to refer to the Food Standard Agency's web statement and Q&A regarding Dasani water attached below. The Coca-Cola Company has issued a press statement (see attached). In addition a consumer care line has been set up by the company, the number for which is: 0800 227 711. Product withdrawal statement issued by the Coca-Cola Company Voluntary withdrawal of Dasani in UK 11.45 am Friday 19 March To ensure that only products of the highest quality are provided to our consumers, Coca-Cola is voluntarily withdrawing all Dasani products currently in the marketplace in the UK. The withdrawal began on Friday, 19 March 2004, and will be 80-85 per cent completed within 24 hours. Calcium is a legal requirement in all bottled water products in the UK, including Dasani. To deliver the required calcium, we add back calcium chloride into the product. Through detailed analysis, we discovered that our product did not meet our quality standards. Because of the high level of bromide contained in the calcium chloride, a derivate of bromide, bromate, was formed at a level that exceeded UK legal standards. This occurred during the ozonisation process we employ in manufacturing. Immediately after we identified this issue, we consulted with the Food Standards Agency. The FSA has confirmed that there is no immediate health or safety issue. The withdrawal is a precautionary measure. If consumers have concerns or wish to return product purchased they should contact the free phone consumer care line 0800 227 711. The care line number appears on all Dasani packs. We are working closely with all our stockists to remove the product from the marketplace. This withdrawal only affects Dasani in the UK market. Our consumers rightly expect that our products meet only the highest possible standards for quality as well as all UK regulations.

Consumers who have a food allergy, or severe food sensitivity, should always read ingredient labels. In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing ingredient is in the food.
                                              
A food allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed.
                                              
Symptoms may include throat swelling, breathing trouble or a rash.
                                              
Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction.
                                              
Several foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.
                                              
Persons who have a severe, life-threatening food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.

63,2009,1,30,us,2009 - meijer announces voluntary recall for some meijer brand peanuts and ice cream novelties citing possible health risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- GRAND RAPIDS, MI – January 30, 2009, Meijer initiated a voluntary recall of two types of its Meijer Brand dry-roasted peanuts and four types of Meijer Brand ice cream novelties sold in all of its stores in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. Meijer removed all identified products from its stores and gas stations. All sell-by dates are impacted by this recall.
Specifically, Meijer has recalled the following items:
Meijer has taken these steps following announcements from the products' manufacturers that they may possibly be contaminated with salmonella. While none of the Meijer brand products have been identified as contaminated or linked to any illness, Meijer has received these products from Nut Bar Company, Inc. and Fieldbrook Foods, both of which used peanuts from Peanut Corporation of America in Blakely, Georgia, which has been verified as the source of contaminated peanut products.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
Meijer requests that customers who have purchased these products destroy the product or return them to any Meijer location for a full refund. If Meijer customers are unsure if they have the recalled product, they are requested to bring in the product for determination or contact the Meijer customer contact center at 800-543-3704. Consumers with questions or concerns about their health should contact their health care provider. If symptoms are present, please visit a health care provider or go to a hospital emergency room.
""The safety of our customers is always our number one priority,” said Frank J. Guglielmi, director of public relations for Meijer. ""Meijer has taken these precautionary steps to help protect our customers and will return this product to our stores only once it is safe for our shoppers.”",biological,ices and desserts,salmonella,ice cream

This action is a result of the PCA expanded recall of January 28, 2009 for all products manufactured in their Blakely, Georgia facility since January 1, 2007.
Salmonella is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.  Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e. infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.  For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
Caramel Candy Bar Ice Cream was distributed in 3 gallon boxes bearing Plant # 36-3918 directly to Stewart’s Shops in New York and southern Vermont.
Stewart’s has had no reports of any illness to date.
Since it has been removed from sale and was sold at the dip counter as dip ice cream in cones and dishes, it is assumed that what has been sold has been consumed.
If for some reason you have Stewarts Caramel Candy Bar ice cream in your home, please return it to the shop where it was purchased for a full refund.  Consumers with questions can contact Stewart’s Shops Consumer Affairs at 518-581-1201 x2130.",biological,ices and desserts,salmonella,ice cream

67,2009,5,17,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america announces voluntary nationwide recall of peanut butter,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (January 13, 2009) – Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions, food service industries, and private label food companies, today announced a voluntary recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely, Georgia processing facility because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
All product affected was produced on or after July 1, 2008, specific to the lot numbers and descriptions listed below.
The peanut butter being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk packaging to distributors for institutional and food service industry use. It is also sold under the brand name Parnell’s Pride to those same industries. Additionally, it is sold by the King Nut Company under the label King Nut. PCA customers who received the recalled product are being notified by telephone and in writing.
None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers through retail stores.
“We deeply regret that this has happened,” said Stewart Parnell, owner and president of PCA. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. We are taking these actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority.”
PCA initiated this recall after an open container of King Nut brand peanut butter in a long-term care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella. King Nut brand peanut butter is produced by PCA.
According to the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota laboratory analyses on the contamination in the already-opened container of peanut butter have the same genetic fingerprint as the cases in the national outbreak that has sickened almost 400 people in 42 states.
The voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds, is being taken immediately. PCA is notifying its institutional customers and has set up a toll-free hotline number 1-877-564-7080 to answer questions.
PCA is continuing to work closely and cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as state officials as part of this ongoing investigation.
According to a CDC update issued on their website today (January 13, 2009), preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials has suggested peanut butter as a likely source. The CDC and other public health officials are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strains, and to gather and analyze data or exposures that may be associated with illness. To date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores.
Customers are asked to take all peanut butter manufactured with the lot numbers listed below out of distribution immediately. Customers can call the following toll-free 24-hour number 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company website at www.peanutcorp.com for additional information.
Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can result in abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever. Most people infected with Salmonella develop the symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses. For more information on the salmonella bacteria, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.

71,2010,1,15,us,New York Firm Recalls Beef Carcass That Contains Prohibited Materials,"WASHINGTON, January 15, 2010 - Jerry Hayes Meats Inc., a Newark Valley, N.Y., establishment is recalling approximately 490 pounds of a beef carcass that may not have had the spinal column removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of spinal cord and vertebral column from cattle over 30 months of age, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 Spinal cord and vertebral column are considered a specified risk material (SRM) and must be removed from cattle over 30 months of age in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.
                                  
 The products subject to recall include: 
                                   1- ""BEEF CARCASS,"" which bears the establishment number ""EST. 04488 M"" inside the USDA mark of inspection.
                                  
 The product was packed on January 7, 2010, and sold to a single customer in New York.
                                  
 The problem was discovered through routine FSIS inspection activities. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product.
                                  
 FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Coli O157: H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, August 6, 2010 - Valley Meat Company, a Modesto, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately one million pounds of frozen ground beef patties and bulk ground beef products that may be contaminated with  
                                  E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
                                  
 FSIS became aware of the problem on July 15 when the agency was notified by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of a small  
                                  E. coli O157:H7 cluster of illnesses with a rare strain as determined by PFGE subtyping. A total of six patients with illness onset dates between April 8 and June 18, 2010 were reported at that time. After further review, CDPH added another patient from February to the case count, bringing the count to seven. FSIS is continuing to work with the CDPH and the company on the investigation. Anyone with signs or symptoms of foodborne illness should contact a health care provider.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160° F.
                                              
 Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as

The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

                                  E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.

 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

74,2010,8,19,us,2010 - NuCal Foods Conducts Recall of Shell Eggs Supplied from Wright County Egg Because of Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Ripon, California - August 17, 2010 - The following statement was released by officials of NuCal Foods of Ripon, California regarding the voluntary recall of shell eggs supplied from Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa.
NuCal Foods is voluntarily recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and packaged by NuCal Foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis or arthritis.
Eggs affected by this recall were distributed to food wholesalers and retailers in California and Nevada. NuCal Foods received these eggs from Wright County Egg which were then packaged into 5-dozen overwrapped retail units. In addition to those products listed in the original Wright County Egg media statement dated August 13, 2010, the following products are being recalled:
 
Dates and codes can be found printed on the overwrap film. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number, for example P-1686 142.
Wright County Egg’s media statement indicates that there have been confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses relating to shell eggs from Wright County Egg, and traceback investigations are ongoing.
Consumers who believe they may have purchased these shell eggs should not eat them but should return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund. This recall is of shell eggs only. Consumers with questions should call 1-877-249-8224 or visit www.eggsafety.org.

83,2011,12,8,hk,Food Alert - Batches of milk powder recalled by Japanese manufacturer following detection of radioactive substances,"Food Alert - Batches of milk powder recalled by Japanese manufacturer following detection of radioactive substances Issue Date 2011-12-08 Source of Information Meiji Dairies Corporation Food Product Milk Powder Product name and Description Details of the affected products are as follows: Brand and food name: Meiji Step Milk Powder (For 9 months - 3 years) Manufacturer: Meiji Dairies Corporation Place of origin: Japan Net weight: 850 grams Best before: October 4, 2012 October 21, 2012 October 22, 2012 October 24, 2012 The picture shows the concerned product “Meiji Step Milk Powder (For 9 months - 3 years)” but of a different batch. Reason For Issuing Alert Batches of the affected milk powder were recalled by its Japanese manufacturer following detection of radioactive substances. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety - The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) met with representatives of importers / distributors and learnt that the affected batches have not been put on sale in the local market. - The CFS has deployed staff to inspect the retail outlets and has, so far, not found any cans of the affected batches on the shelves. - The CFS will continue to liaise with the Japanese authorities on the Japan nuclear incident, closely monitor the situation and take appropriate follow-up actions. Advice to the Trade - Stop importing or selling the affected products. Advice to Consumers - If consumers have bought Meiji milk powder, check the label on the cans to see whether they were the affected batches. - Patronise reliable shops. If in doubt, ask distributors to have a look at the letter issued by the CFS stating that the concerned Japanese food consignments had passed the CFS' radiation test. - According to the test results released by Meiji Dairies Corporation, the radiation levels detected in the milk powder concerned were very low and unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Further Information The CFS press release The surveillance results on Japanese food products will continue to be uploaded to the CFS website (www.cfs.gov.hk) on working days.

 Consumption of food contaminated with  
                                  Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis. However, listeriosis can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths, as well as serious and sometimes fatal infections in those with weakened immune systems, such as infants, the elderly and persons with HIV infection or undergoing chemotherapy. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

 E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away.
                                              
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for ground meat such as beef and pork is 160° F, and 165° F for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer.
                                              
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

 FSIS became aware of the problem during the course of an  
                                  ongoing investigation of a multi-state outbreak of  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis involving 33 case-patients from 7 states (MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VA, VT-preliminary data, subject to change). Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vermont Department of Health, New York State Department of Health, and New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets, FSIS was able to link illnesses in five case-patients to the ground beef products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store reviews. Illness onset dates among these five case-patients ranged from June 6, 2012 to June 13, 2012. Two of the five case-patients were hospitalized. Leftover product with no packaging information collected during the course of this investigation by the Vermont Department of Health tested positive for  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis with the outbreak strain. This outbreak strain of  
                                  Salmonella Enteritidis is drug sensitive, meaning antibiotics can be effective in treating patients who need them. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC and public health partners on the investigation.
                                  
 Consumption of food contaminated with  
                                  Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses.  
                                  Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

100,2012,10,10,us,"2012 - Dean Foods Company of California and Meadow Gold Dairy Conduct Voluntary Recall of Two Albertsons Brand Ice Cream Varieties - Peanut Butter Cup and Peanut Butter Chocolate in 1.5 Quarts Sizes - Due to Potential Health Risk Posed by Nationwide Sunland, Inc. Peanut Butter","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – October 10, 2012 – The Dean Foods Company of California processing facility in Buena Park, Calif., and Meadow Gold Dairy processing facility in Orem, Utah, are taking the precautionary measure to voluntarily recall two ice cream varieties manufactured for Albertsons supermarkets. This recall was initiated because the affected products contain a peanut butter ingredient supplied by Sunland, Inc. which may be contaminated with Salmonella. The peanut butter manufacturer Sunland recently expanded its nationwide product recall.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
To date, no complaints or reactions have been reported related to these ice cream products, and only two flavors of Albertsons ice cream are included in the recall. No Meadow Gold® brand ice cream products are included in this recall. Both the “Peanut Butter Cup” and “Peanut Butter Chocolate” flavors are sold in 1.5 quarts (1.42L) cardboard cartons in Albertsons stores. Only the ice cream made in two plants is impacted by this recall and therefore the product being recalled was sold between 3/26/2010 and 9/25/2012 only in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington.
The ice cream is printed with one of two plant codes: either 49-11 or 06-20 and a “BEST BY” or “EXP” date ranging from 3/26/2011 to 9/25/2013.
No other Albertsons or Meadow Gold brand ice cream products are affected by this recall. In particular, this recall only impacts Albertsons ice cream products with the plant codes of 49-11 or 06-20 and sold in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington.
The processing facilities have ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product package to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the Company at 1-800-587-2259 between 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central Time, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been notified of this voluntary recall.

103,2012,10,17,us,2012 - Dole Fresh Vegetables Announces Precautionary Recall of Limited Number of Salads.,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - October 17, 2012 - Monterey, California– October 17, 2012 – Dole Fresh Vegetables is voluntarily recalling a limited number of cases of Dole American Blend salad in 12 oz. bags, coded A275208A or B, with Use-by date of October 17 and UPC 7143000933, due to a possible health risk from Listeria monocytogenes. Dole Fresh Vegetables is coordinating closely with regulatory officials. No illnesses have been reported in association with the recall. The product code and Use-by date are in the upper right-hand corner of the package; the UPC code is on the back of the package, below the barcode. The salads were distributed in 10 U.S. states (Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin). No illnesses have been reported in association with the recall. This precautionary recall notification is being issued due to an isolated instance in which a sample of Dole American Blend salad yielded a positive result for Listeria monocytogenes in a random sample test conducted by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture. No other salads are included in the recall. Only the specific Product Codes, UPC codes and October 17, 2012 Use-by date identified above are included in the recall. Consumers who have any remaining product with these Product Codes should not consume it, but rather discard it. Retailers and consumers with questions may call the Dole Food Company Consumer Response Center at (800) 356-3111, which is open 8:00 am to 3:00 pm (PT) Monday - Friday. Dole Fresh Vegetables customer service representatives are already contacting retailers and are in the process of confirming that the recalled product is being removed from the stream of commerce. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause foodborne illness in a person who eats a food item contaminated with it. Symptoms of infection may include fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. The illness primarily impacts pregnant women and adults with weakened immune systems. Most healthy adults and children rarely become seriously ill.

104,2012,10,22,us,Recall Notification Report 067-2012,"WASHINGTON, Oct 22, 2012 - BEF Foods Inc., a Columbus, Ohio, corporation, is recalling approximately 1,768,600 pounds of Bob Evans Maple Links and Maple Patties because they are misbranded in that they contain monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is not declared on the label. The products were produced at establishments in Hillsdale, MI and Xenia, OH.
The products subject to recall include:12-oz. packages of Bob Evans Maple Links with UPC numbers of 075900002300, 075900000085 and 075900002324.

12-oz. packages of Bob Evans Maple Patties with UPC numbers of 075900002508 and 075900000795 and 075900002522.

The products were produced between April 4, and Oct. 19, 2012, and will have the establishment number M-952 or M-6785 inkjetted on the side of the package. Product purchased fresh will have a use-by date between Oct. 14, 2012 and Dec. 4, 2012 listed. Instead of a use-by date, frozen products may be identified by any of the following Julian codes: 0264 through 0365, 1001 through 1365, and 2001 through 2293.
The problem was discovered by the company during a label audit. When the company reformulated their products, they discontinued the use of a spice blend containing MSG and removed MSG from the ingredient list on the label. During the label audit, the company discovered that the individual establishments were still using a spice blend containing MSG. MSG is not classified as an allergen, but can cause a reaction in people with a sensitivity to MSG.
FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks (including at restaurants) to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.
Media with questions about the recall should contact the companys Director of Corporate Communications, Margaret Standing, at (614) 492-4921. Consumers should call the companys guest relations line at 1-800-939-2338.",fraud,"meat, egg and dairy products",undeclared additive,other types of meat

The voluntary recall is limited to these two days of production, which were distributed nationwide. No other production dates, sizes or varieties of LEAN CUISINE products are affected by this recall.

For this reason, Nestlé is reaching out to consumers to ask that they examine their freezer inventory for specific packages of LEAN CUISINE®, Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli, UPC 13800-58358 with production codes 2311587812 and 2312587812 and a “best before date” which appears as DEC 2013. To locate the production code, consumers should look for the gray “proof of purchase” panel, located on the right end flap of the package, below the ingredient statement.
Consumers who may have purchased the recalled LEAN CUISINE item should not consume the product, but instead should contact Nestlé Consumer Services at (866) 586-9424 or leancuisine@casupport.com for further instructions. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., ET and this Saturday, February 9, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Nestlé will provide a replacement coupon to reporting consumers and also may make arrangements to retrieve the product for further examination.

119,2013,7,13,us,2009 - torres hillsdale country cheese llc expands the recall of asadero and oaxaca cheeses due to possible listeria contamination,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- March 23, 2009 -- Torres Hillsdale Country Cheese of Reading, Michigan is expanding the recall of Asadero and Oaxaca soft Mexican-style cheeses due to potential Listeria contamination.   
Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause Listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Listeriosis can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths. The very young, the pregnant, the elderly and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to infection. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.
Products were distributed to the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Alabama.
A routine sample of Asadero cheese, taken by an inspector from the Michigan Department of Agriculture’s Food and Dairy Division on February 23, 2009, was subsequently tested by the Michigan Department of Agriculture Laboratory and discovered to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.
The recalled Asadero and Oaxaca cheese products were distributed to retails stores and delis in 10 lb balls, 16- and 12 oz plastic packages, sold under the name ""Aguas Calientes"".

120,2013,7,16,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america provides additional information about expanded nationwide recall of peanut products,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (February 8, 2009) -- In connection with the January 28, 2009 expanded recall announcement issued by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), the company wishes to highlight important information regarding several of its products.
On January 28, 2009, PCA announced it was voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its Blakely, Georgia facility since January 1, 2007 because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurisms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
PCA has not manufactured any products in cans and jars since 2007. However, because the January 28th recall notice indicated that PCA does not sell products directly to consumers in stores, and because the expanded recall includes PCA products made since the beginning of 2007, the potential for confusion may exist. Therefore, the company is highlighting information about those former retail offerings to assist consumers who may have purchased those products and who may still have them in their possession. These products were part of the January 28th recall, but here, they are individually listed. Consumers should be aware that the list below includes only PCA's own brands that were sold to consumers at retail. The list does not include brands made by PCA for other firms. FDA continues to update its website to alert the public about any new recalls.
PCA sold its Casey’s, Parnell’s Pride, Reggie, and Robinson Crusoe labels to 99 Cent Stuff, 99 Cents Only Stores, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree Stores. Below is a list of items and UPC codes that were shipped to these discount retail chain stores and other customers that are affected by this recall:

126,2013,8,23,us,California Firm Recalls Cured Pork Products Due To Misbranding And Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 23, 2013 – Westlake Foods, a Santa Ana, Calif., establishment, is recalling approximately 47,419 pounds of cured pork products because of misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products contain wheat, a known allergen which is not declared on the labels.

The products subject to recall include:

11-lb. to 13-lb. blocks of “Tay Ho Cured Pork Artificially Colored.” This product was distributed for institutional use nationwide.

14-oz. packages of “Tay Ho Cured Pork Sausage With Pork Ears And Snouts.” This product was distributed for retail sales nationwide.

The problem was discovered by an FSIS inspector during a routine label review. The problem is believed to have occurred due to a change in the company’s spice mix, which was not reflected on the products’ labels.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

131,2013,10,12,us,California Wholesale Store Recalls Rotisserie Chicken Products Due to Possible Salmonella Heidelberg Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12, 2013 – Costco’s El Camino Real store in South San Francisco, Calif., is recalling 9,043 units (approximately 39,755 lbs.) of rotisserie chicken products that may be contaminated with a strain of Salmonella Heidelberg, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The products subject to recall are:

8,730 “Kirkland Signature Foster Farms” rotisserie chickens

313 total units of “Kirkland Farm” rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad
The products were sold directly to consumers in a Costco located at 1600 El Camino Real, South San Francisco, Calif., between Sept. 11 and Sep. 23, 2013.

This recall was initiated due to concerns about a group of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that may be associated with the consumption of rotisserie chicken products prepared in and purchased at the Costco El Camino Real store. The PFGE pattern (0258) associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the United States. FSIS, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health and the County of San Mateo Public Health Department, determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the Costco El Camino Real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, public health partners in California and Costco on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available.

This group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multi-drug resistant. For more information about the larger cluster, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Costco has already taken steps to contact every customer who purchased rotisserie chicken products. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts.

Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact Costco at (800) 774-2678.

FSIS reminds consumers to properly handle raw poultry in a manner to prevent contamination from spreading to other foods and food contact surfaces.

FSIS further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular, while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 °F internal temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is important that the final temperature of 165 °F must be reached for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product, but use a food thermometer.

All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165° F as determined by a food thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day.

Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis:

Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing.

If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures (160º F for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º F for all poultry, as measured with a food thermometer) before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.",biological,"meat, egg and dairy products",salmonella,chicken and chicken preparations

Each package bears the establishment number “Est. 11041” inside the USDA Mark of Inspection. The products were sold at the wholesale and retail level in Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Nevada, Texas and by phone orders.

The problem was discovered by FSIS personnel during a food safety assessment. The inspector was reviewing processing records and found that the water level in the product may have been high enough to allow for the production of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a physician.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

133,2014,3,7,us,Arkansas Firm Recalls Chicken Products Due To Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, March 7, 2014 – George’s Inc., a Springdale, Ark. establishment, is recalling approximately 29,200 pounds of seasoned raw, chicken breast strips due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products are formulated with soy protein, a known allergen, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). However, the product was released with a label for George’s boneless skinless breast pieces with rib meat, which does not declare soy or MSG on the label.

The products subject to recall bear the label:

40 lb. bulk cartons of “GEORGE’S BONELESS SKINLESS BREAST PIECES W/RIB MEAT” with case code 4790.
The products were produced and packaged from Dec. 21 through Dec. 23, 2013, and were sold to distributors in Tennessee and Iowa for further distribution. The recalled products bear the establishment number “P-13584” below the USDA Mark of Inspection and “Packed on” date in the format of “mm/dd/yy” on the carton label.

The problem was discovered after the company received a customer complaint of incorrectly labeled product. The customer noticed that the product they received appeared to be seasoned, when it was labeled as being simply boneless, skinless breast pieces. The company’s investigation found that the mislabeling occurred when the George’s label was mistakenly applied to allergen containing products packaged nearby. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Consumers with questions about the recall should contact Ali Perry at (479) 927-7256. Media with questions about the recall should contact Glen Balch at (479) 927-7105 or Dirk Lemmons at (479) 927-7106.

138,2014,5,29,us,Recall Notification Report 033-2014 (Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts),"WASHINGTON, May 29, 2014– Boulder Natural Meats, a Denver, Colo., establishment, is recalling approximately 363 pounds of Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts due to misbranding, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The product was formulated with wheat, which is declared on the product label, so all allergens are properly identified. However, the front label states the product is gluten free. Products with a gluten free claim may not contain wheat.

The following product is subject to recall:

1 to 1.5-lbs. vacuum sealed packages of “Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts brushed with Teriyaki Seasoning”
The product was produced May 13 and 14, 2014, and has a freeze by date of 05.24.14 or 05.25.14. The product bears the establishment number “P18852” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was sold to retail establishments in Colorado.

The problem was discovered by a retailer, which notified the company. After an investigation, it was determined that the front label was mislabeled “gluten free,” because an older label was mistakenly used.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of the product. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Consumers and media with questions about the recall should contact Heather Crane at (303) 301-5293.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 ° F.

161,2015,3,7,us,rio tex wholesale meats recalls ready-to-eat beef products due to possible listeria contamination,"WASHINGTON, March 6, 2015 – Rio Tex Wholesale Meats, a Mercedes, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 58,180 pounds of ready-to-eat beef products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The beef products were produced on various dates between March 25, 2014 and February 19, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods COOKED BEEF TACO FILLING.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods SEASONED COOKED BEEF BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods FULLY COOKED BARBACOA.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods BEEF CARNE GUISADA.”

15-lb. and 45-lb. boxes containing three 5-lb. or 15-lb. packages of “Rio-Tex-Meats BARBACOA.”
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 13545” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped for hotels, restaurants and institutional use in Texas.

The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel reviewed historical sampling data in the context of recent intensified verification testing with multiple Listeria monocytogenes positives. The historical sampling showed a recurrence of Lm isolates with indistinguishable Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns over a period of time within the establishment. The presence of isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns in environmental samples (including food contact and non-food contact surfaces) and on ready-to-eat meat products indicates that there are insufficient sanitary measures to prevent contamination of the production environment and the products with Lm.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

164,2015,4,1,us,Robber’s Roost Jerky Recalls Beef and Pork Jerky Product Due to Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, April 1, 2015 –Robber’s Roost Jerky, an Ellensburg, Wash., establishment, is recalling approximately 4 pounds of ready-to-eat smoked beef and pork pepper stick jerky product that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The fully cooked beef and pork pepper stick jerky product was produced on March 24, 2015. The following product is subject to recall:

6” individual Cryovac sticks of “Smoked Beef & Pork Pepper Stick” with package code 032420150004. 
The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “EST. 19962M” inside the USDA mark of inspection. This product was shipped to local retail outlets in Washington.

The problem was discovered by the company after a sample from the cutting board used in preparation of the product returned a positive test result for Listeria monocytogenes. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illness due to consumption of this product.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Mitch Truax, Operations Manager, at (509) 933-2211.

The whole hogs for barbeque item were produced on various dates between April 18, 2015 and July 27, 2015. The following products are subject to recall:

Varying weights of Whole Hogs for Barbeque
The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “Est. 1628” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was shipped to various individuals, retail locations, institutions, and distributors in Alaska and Washington.

On July 15, 2015, the Washington State Department of Health notified FSIS of an investigation of Salmonella I4,[5],12:i:-illnesses. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FSIS determined that there is a link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and these illnesses. Traceback investigation has identified 32 case-patients who consumed whole hogs for barbeque from this establishment prior to illness onset. These illnesses are part of a larger illness investigation. Based on epidemiological evidence, 134 case-patients have been identified in Washington with illness onset dates ranging from April 25, 2015 to July 29, 2015. FSIS continues to work with our public health partners on this ongoing investigation.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145° F with a three minute rest time. The only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ. For whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in several places. Check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. Remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 1-2 hours.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact John Anderson, Owner, at (253) 847-1777.

Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella can experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The products were distributed to food service and retail stores throughout Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and West Virginia.
Products were distributed under the following brand names: Blue Goose Market, Hollywood Market, Market Fresh Fine Foods, Roger's Foodland, Marv & Alison's Marketplace, Long Lake Market, Martin's, Holiday Market, The Purple Onion, Trentwood Farms, Angeli Foods, Market Square, Village Food Market, Martha's Vineyard, Remke Market or as generic product without branding.
The affected products can be identified by:
There are no reported illnesses in connection with these products to date.
This was brought to our attention by our supplier, International Foodsource, LLC who recalled raw pistachios after testing performed by an FDA contract testing laboratory revealed the presence of Salmonella. As a precaution, Lipari Foods products are being recalled as they have the potential to be contaminated due to the fact that they were packed from an affected lot that was received from International Foodsource, LLC. We are working closely with International Foodsource, LLC and the FDA to understand the cause of the situation and ensure that all affected product has been pulled from commerce.
Consumers who have purchased this recalled product should not consume it. They should return it to the point of purchase.

The recalled ""Energizer Drink Mix,"" was Agua Vitae Liquid Multi-Vitamin, Agua Vitae Kids Multi-Vitamin and Tox-Elim distributed nationwide in retail stores and through mail orders.
The ""Energizer Drink Mix"" comes in 0.3 ounce, plastic packet marked with lot #14592 and #15411 for the strawberry/banana batches, lot #14593 and #15431 for the citrus batches and lot #14594 and 15432 for the pomegranate batches. The lot number can be found embossed on the top seal of the packet.

The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the milk and soy allergen from Whey Protein was utilized by the manufacturer instead of a soy/milk free protein and therefore did not reveal the presence of the soy/milk allergen.

Production of the product has been suspended until the company is certain that the problem has been corrected.

An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-5837” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were distributed to Arkansas for institutional use.

The problem was discovered on July 7, 2016, when Simmons Prepared Foods, Inc. received notice from a supplier that flour sold to the establishment was recalled by General Mills. The firm used the recalled flour to bread the chicken fritters affected by this recall action.

Information on the General Mills’ recall can be found at:http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm509693.htm.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O121 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O121 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O121 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Bar-S Foods notified FSIS’ Dallas District Office on July 19, 2016, of its intention to recall five chicken and pork hot dog and corn dog products that could potentially be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The firm has not received test results for Listeria monocytogenes in connection with the recalled products, but due to recurring Listeria species issues at the firm, it has decided to remove the products from commerce as a precautionary measure. There have been no confirmed reports of illnesses or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
There have been no reported illnesses to date.
This voluntary recall is the result of testing by a FDA-contracted laboratory which revealed that a 4oz package of Diamond of California® Chopped Macadamia Nuts contained Salmonella.
This voluntary recall covers only the following products:
The voluntary recall is limited to multiple production codes of the two products listed below. To locate the production code on the package, consumers should look on the front of the package. No other production codes, sizes or varieties of Diamond of California® products are affected by this recall.
Consumers who may have purchased the product listed above should not consume it but should contact Consumer Affairs for a full refund online at http://diamondfoods.com/contact/ or by calling 503-364-0399 between 8am and 5pm Pacific Time, Monday – Friday.

The recall includes the products listed below; these were distributed to retail outlets, including food service accounts and supermarkets, in the U.S. and Canada.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.  The company is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution.
Consumers with any product with a “Best Before” date up through January 23, 2017 are urged to discard it. Consumers can find code and “Best Before” date on the lid of each package.

244,2017,1,10,us,Palmer Candy Company Announces Voluntary Limited Recall of Select Candy Products,"Palmer Candy Company (www.palmercandy.com), a privately-held, fifth-generation manufacturer of chocolate and holiday confections, announced today a limited recall of certain chocolate products after being informed by a supplier that a milk powder ingredient used in a compound chocolate coating that they supply to Palmer Candy Company has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. The voluntary recall, in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) includes selected products produced between October 20, 2016 and December 9, 2016 and shipped by Palmer Candy Company to grocery, convenience store and wholesale customers nationwide. 
Recalled products include the following:
UPC #s are usually on the back of the bag or bottom of containers. Product photos are attached.
To date, there have been no reported illnesses associated with any of the products affected by this recall. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The recall is the result of a potentially contaminated milk powder ingredient recalled by Valley Milk Products, a derivative of which was included as a small portion of the ingredients by another company in a confectionary coating supplied to Palmer Candy Company. Affected products include a variety of candy products sold to retailers under the Palmer Candy Company brand, private label chocolates for retail distribution and bulk products provided to retailers for repackaging. Although testing has shown no pathogenic bacteria in the milk confectionary coatings, the company decided out of an abundance of caution to recall all products produced using any amount of the now recalled ingredients.
Marty Palmer, president and chief executive officer of Palmer Candy Company said, “We are truly sorry for any distress this recall causes to our retail customers and to consumers. We remain committed to the highest standards in food quality and safety. We are taking this recall very seriously and truly appreciate the cooperation of our customers as we work to resolve this matter promptly.”
Consumers should throw out or return these products to the point of sale for a full refund. For more information, consumers may call to speak with a Customer Service Representative at Palmer Candy Company between 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Standard Time at 712-258-5543.
The Palmer Candy Company, founded in 1878, is a leading manufacturer of a wide variety of high quality chocolate and specialty confectionary treats. The company ships from its two facilities in Sioux City, Iowa to grocery, convenience store and wholesale customers nationwide. The company president and chief executive officer, Marty Palmer, is a fifth-generation owner of the privately-held company.

(SCI), a subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM), is recalling a specific lot of dry roasted almonds because they may contain undeclared cashews. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to cashews run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the cashew-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of cashews. 
The recalled dry roasted almonds were distributed between December 22, 2016, and January 19, 2017, to three customers, one of whom redistributed them for sale in either bulk bins or clam shells to retail outlets in California, including Safeway and Nugget Markets. Representatives of SCI are working with DSD Merchandisers Inc., the distribution customer, and these outlets to ensure the product is removed from shelves and returned. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this issue. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary process irregularity that occurred at the third-party contract manufacturer that processed and packaged the almonds for SCI. Then, an inventory processing irregularity resulted in the almonds being forwarded to the impacted customers. Please direct any customer inquiries to 770-752-8229 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday.

However, severe complications such as septicemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in the newborns. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety - Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up with the importer concerned. The importer confirmed that about 39 kilograms of the above-mentioned products have been imported to Hong Kong and were only supplied to city'super supermarket for sale. - The supermarket concerned has already stopped sale and removed from shelves the affected products. - The CFS will continue to closely monitor the situation and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. Advice to the Trade - Stop using or selling the products concerned immediately should they possess them. Advice to Consumers - Not to consume the products concerned. Further Information The CFS press release - The importer has initiated a recall.

In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Packages containing butcher ground to order “HALAL GROUND BEEF.”
These items were sold to consumers at the firm’s retail location in Tennessee.

The problem was discovered through routine FSIS retail sampling. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

These items were distributed to retail stores and food service locations in Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.

The problem was discovered when the Illinois State Meat Inspection Service notified FSIS on May 2, 2017, about positive non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) samples made with source material produced by Marcho Farms, Inc. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) outbreaks are rare, but tend to primarily be due to contaminated food and person-to-person transmission.Like E. coli O157:H7, non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

1-888-MPHOTLINE or visitwww.fsis.usda.gov

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.

Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and egg products and cooked foods.

Color is NOT a reliable indicator that meat has been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria.

The only way to be sure the meat or poultry is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.

- Beef, pork, lamb chops/steaks/roasts: 145°F with a three minute rest time

The Monte Cristo (turkey, ham, cheese, on French toast) sandwiches were produced from May 1, 2014 through February 1, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Label (PDF Only)]

13.25-lb. bulk cases containing 200 “Kabobs MONTE CRISTO TURKEY BREAST, HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH” in shrink wrapped plastic trays and bearing case codes: PM14E27, PM14H14, PM14J10, PM14E01, PM14E12, PM14E13, PM15C26, PM15E06, PM15G23, PM14L18, PM15A08, PM15C26, PM15K20, PM16B08, PM16B09, PM16F22, PM16F24, and PM17B01.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-6640” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutional locations in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas.

The problem was discovered when Kabob’s Acquisition, Inc., was notified by their French toast ingredient supplier, that the French toast used in the sandwich products was recalled due to potential Lm contamination. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Check to see if you have recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration.

335,2018,7,25,us,AMPI Recalls Limited Amount of Dry Whey Powder Because of Possible Health Risk,"Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) of New Ulm, Minn., is recalling dry whey powder packaged in 50-pound and 25-kg bags that were produced at the cooperative’s Blair, Wis., dry whey plant from May 1-5, 2018; May 24-29, 2018; June 2-5, 2018; and June 7-14, 2018 due to the potential to be contaminated with salmonella. This is a precautionary recall. All products shipped to the marketplace tested negative for salmonella.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The products included in the recall can be identified by the following lot numbers, which can be found printed along the top of the bag. Images of the bags can be found below.
AMPI dry whey powder is not sold directly to consumers, but is used as an ingredient in a number of foods. It is sold directly to manufacturers and also distributed by brokers. A limited amount was sold for animal feed. All products shipped into the marketplace tested negative for salmonella as part of AMPI’s routine testing program. However, because additional product tested positive for salmonella under AMPI’s routine test and hold procedures, the company is recalling product as a precautionary measure. AMPI has ceased production at its Blair, Wis., dry whey plant, is currently investigating the cause for the positive samples, and will take all necessary remedial actions.
All customers that have received the dry whey powder lots have been notified by AMPI and instructed to return the recalled powder, or to document the destruction of the powder, after contacting AMPI for specific instructions.
At AMPI, we are dedicated to producing dairy products that meet the highest quality and safety standards required by our customers as well as complying with all government food safety requirements. We are recalling this product as a precautionary measure and in keeping with our commitment to the best interests of our customers and consumers, and in line with the Food Safety Modernization Act and FDA requirements. We will continue to work cooperatively with the FDA to provide products that meet our customers’ requirements, meet government food safety standards, and provide the nutritious benefits of dairy products to customers throughout the United States.

353,2018,12,4,us,"JBS Tolleson, Inc. Recalls Raw Beef Products due to Possible Salmonella Newport Contamination","EDITOR’S NOTE:


Editor’s note: This release is being reissued as an expansion of the Oct. 4, 2018 recall. The scope of this recall expansion now includes an additional 5,156,076 pounds of raw beef products, which were produced and packed from July 26, 2018 to Sept. 7, 2018. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Editor’s Note: FSIS and our public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health officials, are investigating a Salmonella Newport outbreak. Please note that FSIS is continuing to investigate illnesses associated with this widespread outbreak, and additional product from other companies may also be recalled. Salmonella is prevalent and can be present in raw poultry and meat – no raw poultry or meat is sterile. In addition to discarding the product associated with this recall, consumers can protect themselves now and in the future by ALWAYS cooking their raw meat to a safe internal temperature, which is measured by using a food thermometer. The cooking process kills the Salmonella. No one should be eating partially cooked or raw meat. Additionally, it is essential that people wash their hands after handling raw poultry, meat, and pet food to avoid cross contamination.



WASHINGTON, Dec. 3, 2018 – JBS Tolleson, Inc., a Tolleson, Ariz. establishment, is recalling approximately 12,093,271 pounds of non-intact raw beef products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Newport, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The raw, non-intact beef items, including ground beef, were packaged on various dates from July 26, 2018 to Sept. 7, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: [Products List (PDF)| Product Labels (PDF only)|
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 267” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a retail locations and institutions nationwide.

After FSIS Recall 085-2018 on October 4, 2018, FSIS, CDC, and state public health and agriculture partners continued to investigate the outbreak of Salmonella Newport illnesses. The epidemiological investigation has identified 246 confirmed case-patients from 26 states with illness onset dates ranging from July 26 to September 7, 2018. An additional 16 case-patients have provided receipts or shopper card numbers for the product traceback investigations. Specific traceback for three case-patients have identified JBS Tolleson, Inc., EST. 267 ground beef products that were not part of the October 4, 2018 recall. FSIS will continue to work with public health partners and provide updated information should it become available. 
Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°F. Other cuts of beef should be cooked to a temperature of 145 °F and allowed to rest for at least 3 minutes. The only way to confirm that ground beef or other cuts of beef are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

FSIS and public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, have been investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Schwarzengrund illnesses involving 5 case patients from 2 states. Wisconsin collected three intact Butterball brand ground turkey samples from a residence where 4 of the case patients live. The case patients and ground turkey Salmonella Schwarzengrund isolates are closely related, genetically.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

372,2019,3,23,us,Henry Avocado Recalls Whole Avocados Because Of Possible Health Risk,"Henry Avocado Corporation is voluntarily recalling California-grown whole avocados sold in bulk at retail stores because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Henry Avocado is issuing this voluntary recall out of an abundance of caution due to positive test results on environmental samples taken during a routine government inspection at its California packing facility. There are no reported illnesses associated with this recall.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
The recalled products – California-grown conventional and organic avocados -- were packed at Henry Avocado’s packing facility in California and distributed in Arizona, California, Florida New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin. All shipments from the packing facility are subject to the recall (Henry Avocado did not begin packing there until late January 2019). Avocados imported from Mexico and distributed by Henry Avocado are not subject to the recall and may continue to be sold and consumed.
Henry Avocado is contacting all affected customers to confirm that the recalled products are immediately removed from store shelves. For conventional products purchased at retail, consumers can identify the recalled products by the “Bravocado” stickers. Henry Avocado organic products do not carry the “Bravocado” label on the sticker. Instead those products are labeled “organic” and include “California” on the sticker. Retailers can identify Henry Avocado organic products by the bar code on the stickers.
Consumers who have purchased any recalled avocados are urged not to consume them, but to discard them or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with further questions may contact Henry Avocado at (760) 745-6632, Ext 132 or visit www.henryavocado.com/media
Henry Avocado Corporation is fully cooperating with federal and California health officials to facilitate an efficient and complete recall of these avocados.
“We are voluntarily recalling our products and taking every action possible to ensure the safety of consumers who eat our avocados,” says Phil Henry, President of Henry Avocado.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that this product might be in some consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

386,2019,6,8,us,"Tyson Foods, Inc. Recalls Ready-To-Eat Chicken Fritter Products due to Possible Foreign Matter Contamination","WASHINGTON, June 7, 2019 – Tyson Foods, Inc., a New Holland, Pa. establishment, is recalling approximately 190,757 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken fritter products that may be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically hard plastic, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The frozen ready-to-eat chicken fritter items were produced on February 28, 2019. The following products are subject to recall:[View Labels (PDF only)]

32.81-lb. cases containing four 8.2-lb. bags of “FULLY COOKED, WHOLE GRAIN GOLDEN CRISPY CHICKEN CHUNK FRITTERS-CN” and case code 0599NHL02.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-1325” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The recalled items were shipped to institutional foodservice locations nationwide and were not packaged for retail sale.

FSIS was notified of the problem on June 5, 2019, when Tyson Foods, Inc. advised FSIS of three consumer complaints from schools of foreign material in the breaded chicken fritter product. Tyson Foods, Inc. distributed the product to institutions, including schools. While the product was distributed to schools, it resulted from a commercial sale and was not part of food provided by the USDA for the National School Lunch Program.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in food service freezers. Food service locations who have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

388,2019,6,21,us,Keurig Dr Pepper Announces Voluntary Withdrawal of Unflavored Peñafiel Mineral Spring Water that Does Not Meet FDA Bottled Water Quality Standards,"null BURLINGTON, MA and PLANO, TX - Keurig Dr Pepper today announced it will voluntarily withdraw Peñafiel unflavored mineral spring water products, imported from Mexico, due to the presence of violative levels of arsenic. Arsenic when present in the diet at very high levels, well above those detected in recent samples of Peñafiel, is associated with numerous chronic diseases. Water quality tests of Peñafiel samples conducted by an independent laboratory on behalf of Keurig Dr Pepper detected arsenic at levels that exceeded the FD!’s bottled water standards for mineral water of 10 ppb. All unflavored Peñafiel mineral spring water products including 600mL and 1.5L of all date codes are included in this voluntary withdrawal. The product is packaged in PET bottle formats. Consumers who have this product in their possession can return it to their retailer for a full refund. Peñafiel is a small brand in the U.S. and quantities in the marketplace are very limited, given that Keurig Dr Pepper has already begun to withdraw the products from the market. The Company has notified retailers that it will work with them to remove the product from the market. Arsenic is found in nature, including in aquifers that are the source of mineral water and where levels can vary over time. Keurig Dr Pepper has recently installed enhanced filtration systems at its facilities that produce Peñafiel, and the product now being produced is well within regulatory guidelines. No other Keurig Dr Pepper products are impacted by this voluntary removal. For further information, please contact the Keurig Dr Pepper Consumer Care hotline at (800) 696-5891 between the hours of 9:00 am and 8:00 pm EST, Monday through Friday.

Then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). Sometimes foods have to be withdrawn or recalled if there is a risk to consumers because the allergy labelling is missing or incorrect or if there is any other food allergy risk. When there is a food allergy risk, the FSA will issue an Allergy Alert. Ref: FSA-AA-80-2019 Subscribe to news and alerts",fraud,"meat, egg and dairy products",incorrect labeling,chicken

412,2019,11,10,us,Ezzo Sausage Company Recalls Meat Products due to Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 9, 2019 – Ezzo Sausage Company, a Columbus, Ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 25,115 pounds of sausage products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat sausage products were produced on Oct. 29, 2019, Oct. 30, 2019 and Nov. 5, 2019. This spreadsheet contains a list of the products subject to the recall. [View labels(PDF only) 

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 1838A” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution centers in Indiana and Ohio.

The problem was discovered when the firm notified FSIS of a positive sample result for Listeria monocytogenes.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in distribution centers, restaurants, or institutional refrigerators or freezers. Restaurants and institutions that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Darryl Thompson, V.P Business Development, Ezzo Sausage Company, at (614) 445-8841.

Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-6009” inside the USDA mark of inspection on the case, and on the back of the immediate packaging with the lot code. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 45351A” or “P-45351A” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a distributor and retail locations in California.

The products being recalled are Dole™ Organic Romaine Hearts 3pk (UPC 0-71430-90061-1), combined English/French packaging, with Harvested-On dates of 10-23-20 and 10-26-20, and Wild Harvest Organic Romaine Hearts (UPC 7-11535-50201-2), with Harvested-On dates of 10-23-20 and 10-26-20.  The recall is being conducted due to a possible health risk from E. coli in the two products.  Dole Fresh Vegetables is coordinating closely with regulatory officials. No illnesses have been reported to date in association with the recall.  Pathogenic E. coli can cause diarrhea, severe stomach cramps and vomiting.  Most people recover within a week, but some illnesses can last longer and can be more severe. The Harvested-On sticker is located on the upper right corner of each bag and the UPC code is located on the bottom right corner of the back of each bag. The Dole package contains three organic romaine hearts and the Wild Harvest product is packaged in a 12oz bag. The impacted products were distributed in AZ, HI, IA, IL, IN, KS, MD, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND and VA. These products were harvested and packed nearly 4 weeks ago and should no longer be in commerce.  Consumers are advised to check product they have in their homes and discard any product matching the production description, UPC codes and Harvested-On dates listed above. This precautionary recall notification is being issued due to an isolated instance in which a package of Dole™ Organic Romaine Hearts – 3pk yielded a positive result for pathogenic non-O157 E.coli STEC in a routine sample collected at a retail store by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. There is no indication at this time that this positive result is related to any illnesses nor consumer complaints and it is not associated with the strains connected to the ongoing outbreaks currently under regulatory investigation.  No other Dole products are included in the recall. This voluntary recall does not apply to any bagged or clamshell salad romaine product. Only the specific Organic Romaine Hearts listed, with the exact UPC codes and Harvested-On dates identified above, are included in the recall.

The baked chicken meal products were produced and packaged on September 2, 2020. The following product is subject to recall: [View Label (PDF only)]

8 5/8-oz. (244g) carton trays of “LEAN CUISINE Baked Chicken, white meat chicken with stuffing, red skin mashed potatoes and gravy” with a lot code of 0246595911 and “Best Before” date of October 2021.

The problem was discovered on December 18, 2020, by the firm, after receiving five consumer complaints involving hard white plastic found in the product. The firm believes the mashed potatoes used in the production of the baked chicken meals products had pieces of a plastic conveyor belt that broke during production.

FSIS has received no reports of injury or illness from consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Food Club Garlic Powder, with “best by” dates of NOV 19 22 and NOV 20 22, because they mistakenly contain bacon-flavored bits, which contain soy, an allergen undeclared on the garlic powder labels. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to soy run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the bacon-flavored bits contained in the recalled containers. There is no health risk associated with this product for individuals without an allergy to soy. This recall affects only the following product, which may have been distributed in retail stores nationwide: This recall does not apply to any other “best by” dates, sizes or varieties of Food Club brand products. No allergic reactions or consumer complaints related to this matter have been reported to date. It was determined that 1,301 cases of bacon-flavored bits, which contain soy, an allergen undeclared on garlic powder labels, may contain some individual containers inadvertently labeled as garlic powder. Containers labeled as Food Club Bacon Flavored Bits correctly indicate that the containers include bacon-flavored bits and correctly declare the presence of soy. This recall was initiated in cooperation with the FDA. The recalled product has clear packaging and therefore it should be readily apparent to consumers that any mislabeled containers contain bacon-flavored bits instead of garlic powder. However, out of an abundance of caution, B&G Foods is issuing this recall for containers of Food Club Garlic Powder with the particular “best by” dates listed above. Consumers who have purchased the recalled product can return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Salmonella can cause illness in animals eating the products, as well as people who handle contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products, infected animals or any surfaces exposed to these products.  Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, server headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Healthy people infected with Salmonella should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis (an infection of the heart muscle), arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms. People who have these symptoms after having contact with this product or an animal that has eaten this product should contact their healthcare providers. Pets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have decreased appetite, fever and abdominal pain. Pets exposed to contaminated food can be infected without showing symptoms. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian. Infected animals including those without symptoms, can also shed Salmonella through their feces and saliva, spreading pathogens into the home environment and to humans and other animals in the household. No human or animal illnesses have been reported to date. Bravo Packing, Inc. is voluntarily recalling the products after samples of Performance Dog and a sample of Ground Beef were collected during an FDA inspection, tested positive for Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes.

            WASHINGTON, Aug. 27, 2021 – Fratelli Beretta USA, Inc., a Mount Olive, N.J. establishment, is recalling approximately 862,000 pounds of uncured antipasto products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Infantis and/or Salmonella Typhimurium, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat (RTE) uncured antipasto meat trays were produced on February 28, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The following products are subject to recall [view labels]: 

24-oz. trays containing two 12-oz packages of “Fratelli Beretta UNCURED ANTIPASTO PROSCIUTTO, SOPPRESSATA, MILANO SALAMI & COPPA” with best by dates of AUG 27 21 through FEB 11 22 and UPC code 073541305316.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 7543B” printed on the packaging next to the best by date. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.             

FSIS has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health partners to investigate a multistate outbreak of 36 Salmonella Typhimurium and Infantis illnesses in 17 states, with onset dates ranging from May 9 through July 27, 2021. Some ill people reported eating Fratelli Beretta brand uncured antipasto before they got sick and the traceback investigation confirmed that some of the ill people purchased uncured antipasto trays produced by Fratelli Beretta USA, Inc. FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state and local public health partners on this investigation to determine if additional products are linked to illness. FSIS will provide updated information if it becomes available.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 6 hours to 6 days after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product is in consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

524,2021,11,16,hk,Several prepackaged food samples in breach of food labelling regulation,"Several prepackaged food samples in breach of food labelling regulation The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (November 16) that a sample of prepackaged dates, a sample of prepackaged preserved cabbage and a sample of prepackaged bamboo fungi were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative which is allowed to be used in certain foods, but the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food labels. Members of the public should not consume the affected batches of products. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of products immediately if they possess them. Product details are as follows: Product name: Chinese Date Brand: Green dot dot Place of origin: China Net weight: 350 grams Distributor: Organic Gardens International Limited (recall hotline: 3181 4488) Best-before date: July 23, 2022 Product name: Tianjin Preserved Vegetable Brand: (not available in English) Place of origin: China Net weight: 300 grams Distributor: Golden Long Food Trading Limited (recall hotline: 2566 3007) Best-before date: December 31, 2022 Product name: (not available in English) Brand: Kai's Gourmet Place of origin: China Net weight: 38 grams Importer: Kairun Food HK Ltd. (recall hotline: 3483 0098) Best-before date: July 30, 2022 ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned dates, preserved cabbage and bamboo fungi samples from a department store in Hung Hom, a supermarket in Mong Kok and an online shop for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that the samples contained sulphur dioxide. Although the sulphur dioxide levels are below the maximum permitted level under the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD), the functional class and name of the additive were not declared on the food labels of the samples,"" a CFS spokesman said. ""The CFS has informed the vendors concerned of the irregularities, and instructed them to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batches of products. The above-mentioned distributors/ importer have initiated a recall according to the CFS' instructions. Members of the public may call the respective hotlines above during office hours for enquiries about the recall,"" the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headache and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD). Furthermore, the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 ppm or more, the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.

Dole Fresh Vegetables, Inc.,is voluntarily recalling from the market all Dole-branded and private label packaged salads processed at its Bessemer City, NC and its Yuma, AZ production facilities due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes and is also temporarily suspending operations at both facilities to conduct an extensive cleaning and sanitation protocol. Products subject to the voluntary recall are identified by a product lot code beginning with the either the letter “N” or “Y” in the upper right-hand corner of the package (see examples below) and will have a “Best if Used By” date between November 30, 2021, and January 8, 2022. Consumers who still have any of these products in their refrigerators are urged not to consume the product and to discard it immediately. This suspension of operations and recall are being performed voluntarily by Dole out of an abundance of caution, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The decision to suspend operations and recall all products from these facilities was made after analyzing the strain of Listeria monocytogenes isolated in a single package of Dole-branded Garden Salad produced in the Bessemer City facility and a single package of shredded iceberg lettuce produced in the Yuma, AZ facility. Both of those items were randomly sampled by the state of Georgia and the state of Michigan, respectively, and were a genetic match with a strain of Listeria monocytogenes which FDA and CDC believe is responsible for sixteen illnesses since 2014. Listing of products subject to each of these recalls is set forth below. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Recalled salad items from the Bessemer City facility were distributed in the states of AL, CT, FL, GA, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, MS, NC, NY, OH, PA, SC, TN, and VA. Recalled salad items from the Yuma facility were distributed in the states of AL, AZ, CT, FL, IA, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MI, MN, MS, NC, ND, NY, OH, PA, SC, TN, TX, VA, and WI. No products produced from Dole facilities in Springfield, OH (production/lot codes beginning with “W”) or Soledad, CA (production/lot codes beginning with “B”) are included in these voluntary recalls. In addition, no other Dole products, including “ready-to-eat” salad products, fresh fruit, and field-packed fresh vegetables, are part of these voluntary recalls and are safe to consume. Dole retailers have been advised to check store shelves and warehouse inventories to confirm that no recalled product is available for purchase by consumers. Retailer and consumer questions about the voluntary recalls should be directed to the Dole Consumer Response Center at 800-356-3111, Monday—Friday, 8:00am to 3:00pm Pacific Time.

537,2022,2,9,us,Jan Fruits Inc. Recalls Enoki Mushrooms Because of Possible Health Risk,"February 8, 2022, Jan Fruits Inc. of VERNON, CA is recalling all its cases of its 200g/7.05oz packages of ENOKI MUSHROOM (Product of Taiwan) because it has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. The recalled Enoki Mushroom product was distributed in CA to produce distributors or wholesalers for further distribution to retail stores. The Enoki Mushroom comes in a 200g/7.05oz clear plastic package with the following description “Taiwan Best Quality Enoki Natural Mushroom***Manufacturer: Changhua County Mushrooms Production Cooperative” and “Distributor Jan Fruits Inc.” in English.  There is a green lettered “Premium” Printed with two QR scan codes and UPC 8 51084 00835 8 on the back side of a package.  There is no lot code or dates on a package. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem. The distribution of the product has been suspended. The potential for contamination was discovered after a retail sample collected and analyzed by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in 7.05 oz. package of Enoki mushroom. This recall is being made with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and CDPH. Consumers who have purchased 200g packages of Enoki are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.  Consumers with question may contact the company at 323-923-2879 Ext. 3.

539,2022,2,17,us,Abbott Voluntarily Recalls Powder Formulas Manufactured at One Plant,"Abbott (NYSE: ABT) is initiating a proactive, voluntary recall of powder formulas, including Similac, Alimentum and EleCare manufactured in Sturgis, Mich., one of the company's manufacturing facilities. The recall does not include any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas. Abbott is voluntarily recalling these products after four consumer complaints related to Cronobacter sakazakii or Salmonella Newport in infants who had consumed powder infant formula manufactured in this facility. Additionally, as part of Abbott's quality processes, we conduct routine testing for Cronobacter sakazakii and other pathogens in our manufacturing facilities. During testing in our Sturgis, Mich., facility, we found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the plant in non-product contact areas. We found no evidence of Salmonella Newport. This investigation is ongoing. Importantly, no distributed product has tested positive for the presence of either of these bacteria, and we continue to test. Abbott conducts extensive quality checks on each completed batch of infant formula, including microbiological analysis prior to release. All finished products are tested for Cronobacter sakazakii, Salmonella Newport and other pathogens and they must test negative before any product is released. Additionally, retained samples related to the three complaints for Cronobacter sakazakii tested negative for Cronobacter sakazakii. And the retained sample related to the complaint for Salmonella Newport tested negative for Salmonella Newport. While Abbott's testing of finished product detected no pathogens, we are taking action by recalling the powder formula manufactured in this facility with an expiration of April 1, 2022, or later. No Abbott liquid formulas, powder formulas, or nutrition products from other facilities are impacted by the recall. Cronobacter sakazakii is commonly found in the environment and a variety of areas in the home. It can cause fever, poor feeding, excessive crying or low energy as well as other serious symptoms. It's important to follow the instructions for proper preparation, handling and storage of powder formulas. ""We know parents depend on us to provide them with the highest quality nutrition formulas,"" said Joe Manning, executive vice president, nutritional products, Abbott. ""We're taking this action so parents know they can trust us to meet our high standards, as well as theirs. We deeply regret the concern and inconvenience this situation will cause parents, caregivers and health care professionals."" What Parents and Caregivers Should Do The products under recall have a multidigit number on the bottom of the container starting with the first two digits 22 through 37, contains K8, SH, or Z2 and with an expiration date of April 1, 2022, or after. To find out if the product you have is included in this recall, visit similacrecall.com and type in the code on the bottom of the package, or call +1-800-986-8540 (U.S.) and follow the instructions provided. No action is needed for previously consumed product. If you have questions about feeding your child, contact your healthcare professional.

These products are marketed as dietary supplements and used for treating arthritis, muscle pain, osteoporosis, bone cancer, and other conditions. Walmart has notified customers by email or mail who purchased the above products from third- party sellers on Walmart.com and shipped by Walmart. Customers taking these products should immediately talk to their health care provider to safely discontinue use of the product because suddenly stopping diclofenac may be dangerous. Adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of this product may be reported to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail or by fax.
