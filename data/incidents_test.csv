10,2000,8,19,us,California Grocery Recalls Ground Beef Products for Possible E. coliO157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Aug.
      14, 2000--Bel-Air supermarket, a retail store at 1286 Stabler Lane, Yuba
      City, Calif., is voluntarily recalling approximately 400 pounds of ground
      beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the
      U.S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service
      announced today.
      The ground beef
      products were produced on Aug. 8 and packaged in various sizes. The
      packages are labeled ""PORTERS GROUND BEEF NOT TO EXCEED 20%
      FAT,"" with a ""SELL BY"" date of 08/09/00; ""GROUND ROUND
      NOT TO EXCEED 15% FAT,"" with a ""SELL BY"" date of 08/10/00;
      and ""CERT. ANGUS BEEF, GROUND ROUND, NOT TO EXCD 15% FAT,"" with
      a ""SELL BY"" date of 08/10/00.
      ""Because of
      the potential hazard of foodborne illness from consumption of meat
      products contaminated with harmful pathogens, we urge consumers who have
      purchased the suspect product not to eat it and return it to the place of
      purchase,"" said Thomas J. Billy, FSIS administrator. ""This is an
      opportunity to remind consumers to always follow the safe handling
      instructions required on all raw meat and poultry products and cook ground
      beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.""
      The problem was
      discovered through routine FSIS microbiological sampling.
      
      E. coli
      O157:H7 is a potentially deadly pathogen that can cause bloody diarrhea
      and dehydration. The very young, the elderly, and persons with compromised
      immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
      FSIS has received
      no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product.
      Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a physician.
      Consumers and
      media with questions about the recall may contact Carolyn White,
      communications manager, Bel-Air supermarket, at 1-800-725-3977, ext. 6211.
      Consumers with
      food safety questions can phone the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry
      Hotline at 1-800-535-4555. The hotline can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4
      p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday, and recorded food safety
      messages are available 24 hours a day.

    PREPARING GROUND BEEF
    FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION
    Consumers should only eat ground beef
    patties that have been cooked to a safe temperature of 160 F. When a ground beef patty
    is cooked to 
    160 F throughout, it can be safe and
    juicy, regardless of color. 
    The only way to be sure a ground beef patty
    is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use an accurate
    digital instant-read thermometer.
    Color is not a reliable indicator that
    ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria
    such as E. coli O157:H7. 
    Eating a pink or red ground beef patty
    without first verifying that the safe temperature of 160 F has been reached is a
    significant risk factor for foodborne illness. 
    Thermometer use to ensure proper cooking
    temperature is especially important for those who cook or serve ground beef patties to
    people most at risk for foodborne illness because E. coli O157:H7 can lead to
    serious illness or even death. Those most at risk include young children, the elderly, and
    those with compromised immune systems.",biological,"meat, egg and dairy products",escherichia coli,ground beef

63,2009,1,16,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america expands nationwide recall of peanut butter - 1/17/09,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (January 16, 2009) -- Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions, food service industries, and private label food companies, today announced an expanded recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely, Georgia processing facility as well as the voluntary recall of peanut paste produced in the same plant because these products have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. The company on January 13, 2009 previously announced the recall of 21 lots of peanut butter produced on or after July 1, 2008.
Today's announcement and voluntary recall affect all peanut butter produced on or after August 8, 2008 and peanut paste produced on or after September 26, 2008 at the Georgia facility. The peanut butter being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk packaging in containers ranging in size from five to 1,700 pounds. The peanut paste is sold in sizes ranging from 35 pound containers to tanker containers.
PCA is notifying customers who received the recalled product by telephone or in writing, as well as through the news media and a toll-free 24/7 hotline number. None of the peanut butter or peanut paste being recalled is sold directly by PCA to consumers through retail stores.
""Today, the FDA informed PCA that new product samples in unopened containers tested positive for Salmonella,"" said Stewart Parnell, President of Peanut Corporation of America.
The FDA has not yet confirmed the DNA fingerprints of these positive samples to match the strains causing the outbreaks of food borne illness in several states.
PCA is immediately stopping all production at the Blakely, Georgia facility and notifying its customers to recall and retain all affected product produced during these dates at this plant.
""We deeply regret that this product recall is expanding and our first priority is to protect the health of our customers. Our company has worked around the clock for the last week with federal regulators to help identify any potential problems. Our Blakely facility is currently not operating as we continue to work with federal food safety investigators,""Parnell said.
Customers should call 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company web site at www.peanutcorp.com. 
Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can result in abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever. Most people infected with Salmonella develop the symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover with treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. For more information on Salmonella bacteria, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Website at http://www.cdc.gov.
Peanut Corporation of America is a family-owned and operated business since 1976 based in Lynchburg, VA and operating facilities in Blakely, GA, Suffolk, VA and Plainview, TX.

78,2009,5,31,us,2007 - pa department of health warns consumers of tainted raw milk sold by york county dairy,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Harrisburg, PA -- March 2, 2007 -- State Health Secretary Dr. Calvin B. Johnson today advised consumers who purchased raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy of New Salem, York County, to immediately discard the raw milk due to the risk of contamination with salmonella.
Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized or homogenized.
“We are working very closely with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to conduct local public health investigations,” Dr. Johnson said. “If you have any raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy at home, do not drink the milk and immediately discard it.”
Individuals who drank raw milk purchased from Stump Acres Dairy and became ill are advised to consult with their physician and are also urged to contact their local health department. If no illness occurred, it is not necessary to seek medical attention, but consumers should still discard the raw milk.
This consumer advisory is based on reports to the Department of Health about two confirmed cases and one probable case of Salmonella Typhimurium infection among York County residents who drank raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy in February. Additional cases of illness are suspected.
The Department of Agriculture has suspended sales of raw milk at the dairy and is ensuring that corrective action is taken and that multiple laboratory samples come back negative for Salmonella before raw milk sales can resume.
As part of the investigation, the Department of Agriculture obtained three positive milk cultures from the dairy. A milk sample obtained from consumers also tested positive at the Department of Health’s Bureau of Laboratories.
Stump Acres Dairy has a customer base of about 250 clients. The customers of the dairy are known to be from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. No cases of salmonella infection have been identified at this time in the other states.
The shelf-life for raw milk is about 14 days but can be longer if the milk is frozen.  Freezing of the milk will not kill the salmonella bacteria.
Salmonella is a bacterial infection that affects the intestinal tract and can sometimes affect the bloodstream and other organs. It is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis, which can include diarrhea and vomiting. Approximately 2,000 cases of salmonella are reported each year in Pennsylvania.
Onset of illness usually occurs in 24 to 72 hours and patients typically recover in 5 to 7 days. Patients often do not require treatment unless they become severely dehydrated or the infection spreads from the intestines. People with severe diarrhea may require rehydration, often with intravenous fluids. Antibiotics are not usually necessary unless the infection spreads from the intestines.
For more information on salmonella, visit the Department of Health at www.health.state.pa.us or call 1-877-PA-HEALTH.

Typhoid fever is a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. Salmonella Typhi lives only in humans. Infection results from eating food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding S. Typhi or if sewage contaminated with S. Typhi bacteria gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Once S. Typhi bacteria are eaten or drunk, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream. The body reacts with fever, severe abdominal pain, and other signs and symptoms. Most ill persons need to be hospitalized for antibiotic treatment. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry the bacteria. Both ill persons and carriers shed S. Typhi in their feces (stool).
The recalled ""La Nuestra"" brand Mamey Ice Cream was distributed in the states of NV, and CA, through retail stores & restaurant establishments.
The La Nuestra brand Mamey Ice Cream comes in a 1 pint paper container & also a 1.5 gallon plastic pail. All lot numbers are affected by this recall. The UPC Codes for the 1 pint size ice cream is 7-56869-17610-2 and the UPC Code for the 1.5 gallon size of ice cream is 7-56869-17599-0.

132,2012,8,29,us,2012 - Splendid Products Voluntarily Recalls Daniella Brand Mangoes Because Of Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - August 29, 2012 - Produce distributor Splendid Products is voluntarily recalling certain lots of Daniella brand mangoes because they may be contaminated with Salmonella. The recalled mangoes, a product of Mexico, were sold as individual fruit and can be identified by the Daniella brand sticker and one of the following PLU numbers: 3114, 4051, 4311, 4584 or 4959. The recalled mangoes were sold at various retail stores throughout the U.S. between July 12 and August 29, 2012. Mangoes have been linked to a number of recent cases of salmonellosis in Canada, and may be linked to cases in California and perhaps other states. Although an investigation is still ongoing, out of an abundance of caution Splendid Products is recalling Daniella mangoes in the U.S. The recall is being conducted in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the California Department of Public Health.
The most common symptoms of salmonella are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever, which develop within eight to 72 hours of eating contaminated food. The illness usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. However, salmonellosis can be severe or even life-threatening for infants, older people, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Consumers who believe they may have contracted a Salmonella infection should contact a healthcare provider.
Those who have bought the recalled mangoes are advised not to eat them and to discard them. If there is no identifying sticker on the mango, consider discarding or returning the product to the place of purchase. A copy of this press release with related photos of the product is available on the company website at this address: www.splendidmangos.com .
The products involved in this voluntary recall are:
Mangoes sold as individual fruit with the sticker brand “Daniella” at various retail stores throughout the U.S. between July 12 and August 29, 2012.
“We want to let everyone know our top priority is public safety,” said Splendid Products general manager Larry Nienkerk. “We have notified all of our customers and we are working with all the government agencies that are involved. We didn’t want to wait.”
Consumers who are unsure if the product they purchased is included in the recall or have additional questions, may call us at 866-918-8758 (Monday – Friday, 8:00 AM through 6:00 PM Eastern time and Saturday September 1 from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Eastern time).

134,2012,9,25,us,"2012 - Sunland, Inc. Announces an Expansion of its Voluntarily Limited Recall of Almond Butter and Peanut Butter To Add Cashew Butter, Tahini and Roasted Blanched Peanut Products","UPDATED FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - September 24, 2012 - Sunland, Inc. today announced a voluntary recall of its Almond Butter and Peanut Butter, which it has now expanded to include its Cashew Butter, Tahini and Roasted Blanched Peanut Products. This recall is limited to products manufactured between May 1, 2012 and September 24, 2012. These products may be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The voluntary recall was initiated after learning that between June 11, 2012 and September 2, 2012, twenty-nine people reported Salmonella Bredeney PFGE matching illnesses in approximately 18 states, including Washington, California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland, according to a report issued on September 22, 2012 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
""There is nothing more important to us than the health and safety of our customers, particularly the many families who enjoy our peanut butter everyday. While FDA, CDC, and State Health Agencies investigate to confirm the cause of illnesses reported, as a precautionary step, we have decided to voluntarily recall our Almond Peanut and Cashew Butters, Tahini and Roasted Blanched Peanut products manufactured between May 1, 2012 and September 24, 2012. If you purchased these products, do not eat them. Please return the product to your supermarket for a full refund or dispose of it.""
Statement of Jimmie Shearer, President and CEO of Sunland, Inc.
The recall is being conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). No other Sunland products are affected by this recall.
The products were distributed nationally to numerous large supermarket chains and were available for purchase on the internet.

139,2012,10,22,us,Utah Firm Recalls Ground Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, October 22, 2012 - Main Street Quality Meats, a Salt Lake City, Utah establishment, is recalling approximately 2,310 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
The following products are subject to recall:10-lb cases of ""GROUND BEEF BULK.""

12-lb cases of ""GROUND BEEF PATTIES.""




PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION


Wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/
handwashing . If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.
Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160° F, as measured with a food thermometer, before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.





Each case bears the establishment number ""EST. 19916"" inside the USDA mark of inspection, as well as any of the following identifying lot numbers: ""1018121,"" ""1019121,"" ""1018122,"" or ""1019122."" The products were produced on Oct. 18 and Oct. 19, 2012, and were distributed to restaurants in Utah.
The problem was discovered by FSIS and occurred as a result of the products testing positive for E. coli O157:H7 and being shipped prior to the company receiving test results. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with the consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact the company's Food Safety Coordinator, Scott Schmidt, at (801) 484-5295.",biological,"meat, egg and dairy products",escherichia coli,ground beef

154,2013,7,3,us,"2009 - Harry and David Conducts Hazelnut Recall in Medford, Oregon because of Possible Risk to Health","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – December 18, 2009 – Harry and David is voluntarily recalling raw, shelled hazelnut kernels due to concerns of potential Salmonella contamination. The hazelnuts were sold only in our Harry & David Country Village store located in Medford, Oregon. The hazelnuts were supplied to us by Evonuk Oregon Hazelnuts. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The Harry & David Country Village store removed all the raw, shelled hazelnuts supplied by Evonuk from sale on December 17, 2009. This was done in response to a recall issued on December 17, 2009, by Willamette Sheller, Inc., the company that processed the hazelnuts for Evonuk.
The hazelnuts affected by this recall were sold as Filbert (hazelnut) kernels in bulk bin #10077 only at the Harry & David Country Village store, Medford, Oregon, prior to December 18, 2009.
No known illnesses have been reported to date in connection with the hazelnuts.
Consumers who have purchased any of the bulk hazelnuts from the Harry & David Country Village store are encouraged to return them to the store for a full refund.

166,2013,7,15,us,2009 - theo chocolate issues nationwide recall of,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --Seattle, WA -- February 17, 2009 --- Theo Chocolate, Inc., Seattle, Washington is voluntarily recalling Peanut Butter Big Daddy and Peanut Confections because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Theo Chocolate's other products are not involved in the recall.
Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Peanut Butter Big Daddy and Peanut Confections were sold through retailers nationwide, direct to consumers from our website and at the Theo Chocolate Factory store in Seattle.
Theo Brand PEANUT BUTTER BIG DADDY contains 3 pieces in a brown cardboard package with a red and white sleeve and the UPC code: 8-74492-00023-3. This product has a 90-day shelf life with a ""BEST BY"" sticker located on the underneath of the package. Affected ""BEST BY dates"" are 8/15/2008 to 2/28/2009.
Theo Brand 12 PIECE COLLECTION BOX 4.5 oz contains peanut confections with peanut sprinkles, or individual, loose peanut confections purchased from the Theo Retail Store or website in 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 or 32 piece brown cardboard box packaging and no UPC codes. These products had a two-week shelf life and ""BEST BY"" dates of 8/15/2008 to 12/15/2008.
No known illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this product. This recall was initiated after it was determined that that the peanut product (organic peanut splits) received from our supplier, GloryBee Foods, may have been manufactured by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) at their Texas facility. Theo Chocolate has informed FDA of its actions and is fully cooperating with the Agency.
Consumers who have purchased this product are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers who have purchased the recalled products are urged to destroy them but retain the ""Best By/Sell By"" code found on the back of the package.

168,2013,7,15,us,2009 - s&m (usa) enterprise corp. issues an alert on uneviscerated white herring,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- February 23, 2009 -- S&M (USA) Enterprise Corp at 4703 2nd Ave Brooklyn NY 11232 (Mailing address: 136 Bowery, #417 New York, NY 10013) is recalling White Herring because the product was found to be uneviscerated.
The recalled White Herring was distributed in New York State in uncoded, 16 oz. clear plastic bags.   The White Herring is a product of China.
The White Herring was sampled by a New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Food Inspector during a routine inspection. Subsequent analysis of the product by New York State Food Laboratory personnel confirmed that the White Herring was not properly eviscerated prior to processing.
The sale of uneviscerated fish is prohibited under New York State Agriculture and Markets regulations because Clostridium botulinum spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulism poisoning.
This product may be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum spores, which can cause Botulism, a serious and potentially fatal food–borne illness.  Symptoms of botulism include blurred or double vision, general weakness, poor reflexes, difficulty in swallowing and respiratory paralysis.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.  Consumers that have purchased White Herring are advised not to eat it and should return it to the place of purchase.  Consumers with questions may contact S&M Enterprise Corp. at 718-492-4288.",biological,seafood,clostridium botulinum,Fishes not identified

173,2013,9,12,us,Kansas Firm Recalls Beef Products Due to Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Sep. 12, 2013 – National Beef Packing Company, a Dodge City, Kan., establishment, is recalling approximately 690 pounds of beef tongue root filet products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The following products are subject to recall:

30-lb. boxes of “National Beef” Beef Tongue Root Filet, Product Code “12753.” These products bear the establishment number “EST. 262” inside the USDA mark of inspection and include a pack date of “081913A.”
The products were produced on August 19, 2013, and were shipped to a distributor in Amarillo, Texas, for further processing.

The problem was discovered through routine FSIS monitoring which confirmed a positive result for E. coli O157:H7. An investigation determined National Beef Packing Company was the sole supplier of the source materials used to produce the positive product.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at:http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
Consumers with questions should contact the company at 1-877-857-4143, or visit National Beef’s website at www.nationalbeef.com for details about the recall and the company’s return and reimbursement policy. Media with questions regarding the recall should contact National Beef’s Spokesperson, Keith Welty, at (816) 713-8631.

180,2014,1,17,us,Illinois Firm Recalls Sliced Spiral Hams for Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 17, 2014 – Gusto Packing, a Montgomery, Ill. establishment, is recalling approximately 67,113 pounds of sliced, spiral ham products due to concerns about possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The hams were shipped to wholesalers for further distribution in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, while some were exported to Canada. The following products are subject to recall: [Labels]

45.5-lb. cases, with six individual sized hams each labeled “Centrella Signature, Hardwood Hickory Smoked, Spiral Sliced Ham with Natural Juices” with the case code “71292603304,” packaged on Nov. 29, 2013, having a Use or Freeze by date of “02/06/14.”

45.8-lb. cases, with six individual sized hams each labeled “AMISH VALLEY, Fully Cooked, Hickory Smoked Spiral Sliced Ham” with the case code “71292645104,” packaged on Nov. 29, 2013, having a Use or Freeze by date of “02/06/14.”

45.8-lb. cases, with six individual sized hams each labeled “AMISH VALLEY, Fully Cooked, Hickory Smoked Spiral Sliced Ham” with the case code “71292645104,” packaged on Nov. 30, 2013, having a Use or Freeze by date of “02/06/14.”

Packaging labels bear the establishment number “EST. 2516” inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The problem was discovered when Gusto Packing’s internal sampling program found some of its products tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Those products were frozen and held for reconditioning. Later, Gusto Packing found that some of those ham products inadvertently shipped into commerce. The company then informed FSIS. 

FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact the Gusto Packing customer service hotline toll free at 877-984-8786. Media with questions regarding the recall can contact the company’s public relations office at 919-255-7944.

187,2014,4,24,us,Ontario Firm Recalls Baby Back Ribs Produced Without Import Inspection,"WASHINGTON, April 24, 2014 – Skilcor Food Products, an importer of record in Brampton, Ontario, is recalling approximately 36 pounds of fully cooked pork baby back ribs in honey garlic barbeque sauce, because they were not presented at the border for USDA FSIS inspection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. Without the benefit of full inspection, a possibility of adverse health consequences exists.

FSIS issues a Public Health Alert for an imported product when the country of origin recalls the product. FSIS issues a recall for an imported product when the product is not presented for inspection at the U.S. border.

The following product is subject to recall:

18 pound cases containing 1.5 pound packages of “Cobblestone Farms Fully Cooked Pork Baby Back Ribs in Honey Garlic Barbeque Sauce” bearing package code “Sell By 2015-AL-08” and case code “15201”
The product bears the Canadian mark of inspection with establishment number “624.” The product was distributed to a retailer in New York..

FSIS and the company have received no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.

A failure-to-present (FTP) occurs when importers fail to present a shipment to FSIS for import inspection prior to the product entering U.S. commerce. Failure-to-present will result in the recall of the product.

Presently, FSIS analysts compare Custom and Border Protection Automated Commerce Environment summary data to shipments received in the FSIS Public Health Information System to identify shipments that may not have been presented for inspection at the border. As part of this process, this only occurs after the product has entered U.S. commerce.

FSIS is working on solutions to prevent future failure-to-present episodes from occurring, including outreach to industry, foreign food safety agencies and importers.

189,2014,5,3,us,Missouri Firm Recalls Curry Chicken Salad for Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, May, 3, 2014– Schnucks Kitchen, an O’Fallon, Mo., establishment, is recalling approximately 130 pounds of Curry White Meat Chicken Salad product due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The Chicken salad product, in three-pound bags, was produced on April 24, 2014, and shipped to Schnucks retail grocery locations for deli distribution in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and Wisconsin. The following product is subject to recall:

3-lb. sealed plastic bags containing “CURRY WHITE MEAT CHICKEN SALAD WITH WALNUTS.” [View Label (PDFOnly)]
Because the products were sold at deli counters, consumer packaging may vary. Plastic containers in various sizes may bear a purchase date between April 24, 2014 and May 2, 2014. Bulk case labels or packaging may bear the case code 0989674 or 0963124 as well as establishment number “EST. P-13562” inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The problem was discovered when routine product sampling by FSIS personnel tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes on April 28, 2014. This product was held by the firm and did not enter commerce. Further investigative sampling by the company later determined bulk walnuts from an outside supplier, an ingredient used in the product, may have been contaminated with the pathogen. FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. FSIS is working in partnership with the Food and Drug Administration to further investigate the source of the contamination.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

197,2014,6,11,us,Missouri Firm Recalls Ribeye and Carcass Products That May Contain Specified Risk Materials,"WASHINGTON, June 11, 2014 – Fruitland American Meat, a Jackson, Mo. establishment is recalling approximately 4,012 pounds of fresh beef products because the dorsal root ganglia may not have been completely removed, which is not compliant with agency regulations that require their removal in cattle 30 months of age and older, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The products subject to recall include:

40-lb. cases containing two, roughly 20-lb. cryovac packages of bone-in “Rain Crow Ranch Ribeye” bearing the establishment number “EST. 2316” inside the USDA mark of inspection with the following production dates: 9/5/13, 9/10/13, 9/11/13, 9/26/13, 10/2/13, 10/3/2013, 11/8/13, 11/22/13, 12/17/13, 12/26/13, 12/27/13,1/16/14, 1/17/14, 1/23/14, 1/31/14, 2/13/14, 2/14/14, 2/21/14, 2/28/14, 3/8/14, 3/20/14, 4/4/14 or 4/25/14 printed on the box.
	Quartered beef carcasses stamped with the USDA mark of inspection and establishment number “EST. 2316.”
The products were produced and packaged on various dates between September 2013 and April 2014. The bone-in ribeye roasts were the source material of concern.

Fruitland American Meat advises that the bone-in ribeye roasts were distributed to a restaurant in New York, NY, and a Whole Foods distribution center in Connecticut which services its stores in New England. The quartered carcasses were distributed to an FSIS-inspected establishment in Missouri for further processing and distribution, and to a restaurant in Kansas City, Mo. All products would have been processed into smaller cuts with no identifying consumer packaging.

The problem was discovered by FSIS during a review of company slaughter logs. The problem may have occurred as a result of the way some company employees were recording information and determining the age of various cattle. Dorsal root ganglia, branches of the nervous system located in the vertebral column are considered specified risk materials (SRMs) and must be removed from cattle 30 months of age and older in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that may contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent.

Every animal received ante-mortem inspection by an FSIS Public Health Veterinarian. This involves observing each animal at rest and in motion and there is no indication that any of the cattle slaughtered displayed any signs of BSE.

FSIS and Fruitland American Meat have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS was notified of an investigation of E. coli O157:H7 illnesses on June 25, 2014. Working in conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FSIS determined that there is a link between ground beef purchased at Whole Foods Market and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiologic investigation, 3 case-patients have been identified in Massachusetts with illness onset dates ranging from June 13, 2014 to June 25, 2014. While the onset of illnesses was in June, on August 13, 2014, additional laboratory results provided linkages between the 3 MA case-patients and ground beef purchased from Whole Foods. Traceback investigation indicated that all 3 case-patients consumed ground beef purchased from 2 Whole Foods Market prior to illness onset. FSIS is continuing to work with state and federal public health partners on this investigation to determine a common source and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 ° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

208,2014,8,21,us,California Firm Recalls Chicken Caesar Salad Kits For Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, AUG. 21, 2014 – APPA Fine Foods, a Corona, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 92,657 pounds of fully cooked chicken Caesar salad kit products due to concerns about possible Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) contamination, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The salad kits were shipped nationwide to one bulk warehouse chain for retail sale in its in-store cafés. [APPA Fine Foods produced the kits used by the bulk warehouse chain.] The following products are subject to recall:

11oz. clear plastic containers and 6.5-lb. boxes labeled, “APPA Fine Foods/Sam’s Club Daily Chef CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD KIT” with case codes 141851, 141922, 141951, 141991, 142021, 142201 or 142131 with use by dates of 8/14/14, 8/21/14, 8/27/14, 9/1/14, 9/3/14 or 9/17/14. The kits were produced on July 4, July 11, July 14, July 18, July 21, July 25, Aug. 1 and Aug. 8, 2014.
Box labels bear the establishment number “P-21030” inside the USDA mark of inspection.

Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development personnel informed FSIS they received two confirmed positive Lm results from retail product purchased at one of the bulk warehouse chain locations. The bulk warehouse chain then sampled intact components of the salad kits. Only the chicken came up positive with Lm.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

214,2014,10,17,us,Maryland Firm Recalls Lamb Products Produced Without Import Inspection,"WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 17, 2014 – E.&B.’s Natural Way, a Frederick, Md. establishment, is recalling approximately 27,948 pounds of raw lamb products because they were not presented at the border for USDA-FSIS Import Inspection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. Without the benefit of full inspection, a possibility of adverse health consequences exists.

The lamb products were packaged on October 21, 2013, September 2, 20, 21 and 22, 2014. The following products are subject to recall:

The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “IS A022 EFTA” and include a label indicating “Product of Iceland.” These products were shipped to retail establishments in Washington and Oregon where the products would have been repackaged.

The problem was discovered during a routine review using the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) database.

263,2015,6,3,us,Tyson Fresh Meats Recalls Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, June 3, 2015 – Tyson Fresh Meats, a Dakota City, Neb., establishment, is recalling approximately 16,000 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ground beef items were produced on May 16, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

5 lb. chubs of “80% Lean Ground Beef.”
The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 245C” inside the USDA mark of inspection and a “best before or freeze by” date of June 5, 2015. These products were shipped to one distribution location in New York.

FSIS discovered the problem during a routine sampling program. Neither FSIS nor the company received any reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may have been sold and stored in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume product that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

The problem was discovered during routine sampling. In early April 2015 this establishment underwent construction, and in May 2015, FSIS performed routine Listeria monocytogenes sampling. Environmental, product-contact surface and Ready-to-Eat (RTE) products that were analyzed for sampling were found to be Listeria monocytogenes positive. Additional FSIS and establishment sampling confirmed Listeria monocytogenes contamination.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 772” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The products were shipped for hotel, restaurant and institutional use in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.

The problem was discovered June 30 when the firm received a positive result for E. coli as part of its in-house sampling program. Some products made from the same source material as the positive sample were shipped into commerce.

FSIS and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume beef products that have been cooked to a temperature of 145° F for steaks and roasts and 160° F for ground product. The only way to confirm that beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

287,2015,10,26,us,adolf’s meat products recalls assorted deli meat due to possible listeria adulteration,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 26, 2015 – Adolf’s Meat Products, a Hartford, Conn. establishment, is recalling approximately 224 pounds of assorted meat that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The following items, produced on Oct. 20, 2015, are subject to recall: [View Label]

14-lb. of Smoked Kielbasa
100-lb. of Hams
40-lb. of Canadian Bacon
30-lb. of Bone-In Pork Loins
50-lb. of Liverwurst
The smoked kielbasa products bear establishment number “EST. 34651” inside the USDA mark of inspection, while other products were sold without labels from behind a deli counter. All recalled products were sold at the company’s store, Adolf’s Meat & Sausage Kitchen,  located in Hartford, Connecticut.

The problem was discovered during routine FSIS sample testing. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

300,2015,12,31,us,2015 - Thomas Produce Recalls Cucumbers because of Possible Health Risk,"Thomas Produce Company of Boca Raton, FL is recalling 174 bulk-packed containers of Cucumbers. This product has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella may experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
This product was sold to distributors in Florida and Georgia between 12/15/2015 and 12/16/2015. All distributors that received this product have been notified as of the time of this press release.

The fresh, whole, green Cucumbers were sold in 166 cardboard bushel boxes (1 1/9 bushel size) with one of the following lot numbers ink-jet printed on the side: 1554311JDNK, 1554311HDNK, and 15143115DNK. These cucumbers were also distributed in 8 bulk cardboard bins(4'x4' size) tagged with codes 15NKJD-1554311-D, 15NKHD-1554311-D, and 15NK5D-1514311-D.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this recall.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream area and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis and arthritis.
NO ILLNESSES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS VOLUNTARY RECALL.
The possibility of Salmonella contamination was noted after what we have been informed was a routine testing by a third party customer of FutureCeuticals, a large manufacturer and supplier of organic ingredients in North America. We have been informed by a reliable source that organic spinach powder produced by FutureCeuticals tested positive for Salmonella in another company’s product, not in Boost Tea. Boost Tea also contains this organic spinach powder ingredient obtained from supplier FutureCeuticals.
Upon notification by the FDA of FutureCeuticals Spinach powder issues, Awareness conducted its own investigation and had independent lab analysis performed by two separate analytical laboratories which confirmed a complete absence of Salmonella in its Boost Tea product. Based on Awareness’ utmost concern about product safety, it is conducting this voluntary recall as a preventative measure. To prevent a recurrence of this concern, Awareness has removed organic Spinach powder from Boost Tea and expects new Boost Tea to be available in the next few weeks.
The voluntarily recalled Boost Tea was distributed nationwide by distributors from Awareness. The product’s white plastic container is marked with Lot #022615 on the bottom panel of the container and with an expiration date of 10/17 stamped on the container. It was first sold to distributors on or about December 15, 2015.

The problem was discovered during an FDA recall of frozen corn contaminated with Listeria Monocytogenes. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria Monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

The heat-treated, not fully cooked, not shelf stable chicken fried rice products were produced on various dates between Sept. 24, 2015 and Mar. 23, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [View Label (PDF only)]

20 oz. pail boxes containing AllFresh Foods “ANJOY Chicken Fried Rice.”
Case Codes associated with the “ANJOY Chicken Fried Rice”product are as follows: 092415, 092915, 100215, 101315, 101615, 102015, 102715, 110315, 110615 and 032316.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-31993” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail distributor locations in Colorado, Georgia, Missouri, and Utah.

The problem was discovered when Garland Ventures LTD was notified by their supplier of vegetable fried rice, Ajinomoto Windsor Inc., that frozen foods involved in CRF Frozen Foods’ recall were incorporated in their products. CRF Frozen Foods of Pasco, Washington voluntarily recalled frozen vegetable items due to an illness outbreak of listeriosis. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of Garland Ventures’ products.

The CRF Frozen Foods’ recall can be found at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm498841.htm.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Robert Cocat, Garland Ventures LTD, General Manager, at (972) 485-8878.

353,2016,6,14,us,G & M Co. Recalls Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, June 14, 2016 – G & M Co., a Newark, N.J. establishment, is recalling approximately 3,586 pounds of beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The bulk beef cuts and trimmings items were produced on June 8, 9, and 10, 2016. The following products are subject to recall:

3,586-lbs. - Various box sizes ranging from 30-195 lb. containing plastic wrapped bulk beef cuts and trimmings marked only with plant identifier “M5476.”
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “M5476” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations in New Jersey and New York.

The issue was identified on June 14, 2016, when FSIS Inspection Program Personnel (IPP) conducted trace-back and trace-forward activities after the firm received a confirmed positive for Escherichia coli O157:H7 from FSIS sampling and testing. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume whole beef products that have been cooked to a temperature of 145° F. The only way to confirm that whole beef cuts are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Jose Morales, Plant Manager, at (973) 621-7444.

354,2016,6,16,us,essential foods recalls four flavors of globespun gourmet wraps because of possible health risk,"Essential Foods Inc. of Seattle, Washington is voluntarily recalling four flavors of Globespun Gourmet 8oz wraps because an ingredient (peas) has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
The recalled Globespun Gourmet wraps were distributed in Washington and Oregon to grocery outlets and corporate cafeterias.
The products come in 8oz, plastic wrapped, ready to eat form. The affected products are the following flavors:
The products have a date stamp of 06 17, 06 20 and 06 24 on the bottom of the wrap.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The potential for contamination is connected to a recall of frozen peas which had the potential of testing positive for Listeria monocytogens. Peas are used in the above recipes and are therefore affiliated with the recall.
The production of the product has been suspended while FDA and our supplier work to resolve the source of the issue.
Consumers who have purchased 8oz Globespun Gourmet Thai, Coconut Curry, Tandoori or Dolma La wraps are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

355,2016,6,16,us,HelloFresh Recalls Frozen Peas Because of Possible Health Risk,"HelloFresh of New York, N.Y. is recalling frozen peas due to notification from a supplier that the peas have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The peas were included in HelloFresh recipe kits delivered the week of June 11-15, 2016 and the weeks of March 12-25, 2016.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Currently, no illnesses or customer complaints have been reported to date, however, in an abundance of caution, the company has decided to conduct this voluntary recall. HelloFresh immediately informed their affected customers of the recall and advised them to discard the product.
The peas were delivered by a third party delivery service in Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, and Georgia, as part of the meals ""Summer Vegetable Salad with Seared Chicken, Garlic Croutons, and Mustard-Chive Vinaigrette"" (June 11-15, 2016), ""Lemony Pan-Seared Chicken with Pesto Potato Salad and Peas"" (March 12-18, 2016), and ""Seared Steak with Spring Veggie Succotash and Mint-Chive Pesto"" and ""Nir's Lamb-Stuffed Zucchini with Spiced Lentil Stew"" (March 19-25, 2016). We expect that the March items have already been consumed and no cases of illness have been reported. The peas would have arrived in a portion cup inside a kit box labeled with the recipe names described above.
The pea is most commonly the small spherical seed of the pod fruit Pisum Sativum. Customers in these states are encouraged to discard the entire kit box, and not eat any of the ingredients from that recipe. Following the cooking preparation instructions printed on each individual case will effectively reduce the risk of exposure to this bacterium.
If you have any concerns or are experiencing symptoms linked to this recall, please contact your healthcare provider immediately. If you have any additional questions, please call HelloFresh 1-800-733-2414 during the hours of 6am EST to 11pm EST Monday through Friday and 6am EST to 7:30pm EST Saturday and Sunday.",biological,fruits and vegetables,listeria monocytogenes,frozen peas

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “Est. 6640” or “P-6640” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to hotel, restaurant, and institutional locations nationwide. 

The problem was discovered when a supplier notified Kabob’s Acquisition, Inc. that flour sold to the establishment was recalled by General Mills due to possible association with a multi-state Escherichia coli O121 illness outbreak. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these Kabob’s Acquisition, Inc. products. 

General Mills’ recall can be found at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm509693.htm 

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O121 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O121 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. 

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O121 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

367,2016,7,31,us,Hampton Creek Issues Voluntary Recall of Mixes Containing Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder Because of Possible Health Risk,"San Francisco, CA. - Out of an abundance of caution, Hampton Creek is undertaking a voluntary recall of 6 SKU’s of baking mixes that contain the Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder. The ingredient, which makes up less than 1.31% of the mixes, tested positive for Salmonella in a company-initiated testing program. Hampton Creek immediately notified Native Forest and their distributor, and has requested they initiate a voluntary recall of all their Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder-in all formats-with all retail and food manufacturing customers.
The affected mixes, available nation-wide, are as follows:
Per the FDA’s website, “Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.”
As part of Hampton Creek’s testing program, 30 Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder samples were pulled and tested. 29 of the samples tested negative and one sample tested positive for Salmonella. 74 additional samples taken from other lots of the Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder tested negative.
No other Hampton Creek products were affected, and there have been no reports of any health issues.
All finished mixes released into the market tested negative for any pathogens, but with the presence of Salmonella in the Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder, we notified the FDA of the potential health risk. Consumers who have purchased any of the recalled products should not consume the product, and either discard it or return it to the retailer for a full refund.
“Nothing else matters without safety,” said Hampton Creek’s Founder and CEO, Josh Tetrick. “The guidance we’ve received from the FDA has been vital to ensuring any affected product is removed from the marketplace. You can reach me directly any time at 415.404.2372 or the company at 844.423.6637, M-F 9:00-6pm PST, and wecare@hamptoncreek.com with any and all questions or concerns.”
With the health and safety of consumers being the company’s top priority, Hampton Creek decided to inform the FDA of the Native Forest Coconut Milk Powder concern 2 days before the confirmed test result.

373,2016,8,26,us,"WFSP Foods, LLC Recalls Pork and Chicken Sausage Products Due To Misbranding and Undeclared Allergens","WASHINGTON, Aug. 26, 2016 – WFSP Foods LLC, a Decatur, Ala. establishment, is recalling approximately 18,672 pounds of pork and chicken sausage products due to misbranding and undeclared allergens, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products contain milk, a known allergen which is not declared on the product label.

The ready-to-eat sausage items were produced on June 7, 2016. The following product is subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

13.5-oz. packages containing “Land O’ Frost Simply Savory Bacon & Cheddar Smoked Sausage” with a “BEST BY: DEC. 04 2016” and packaging date of 06/07/16.
The product subject to recall bears establishment number “EST. 45411” printed on the packaging. This item was shipped to retail locations nationwide.

The problem was discovered in a retail store by a company representative and immediately reported to FSIS. The product has the correct label on the front of the package, which identifies that the product contains cheese. However, the label in the back fails to include cheddar cheese as an ingredient – the source of milk. As a result, milk is not included in the ingredients statement or in the “Contains” allergen declaration.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-34800” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to food service distributors in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.

The problem was discovered during routine FSIS verification testing. There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse health effects due to consumption of the products subject to this recall.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some of this recalled product may be in food service distribution refrigerators.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.

The products come in 16 ounce plastic tubs with SKU numbers printed on the top labels and ""USE BY"" date codes stamped on the bottom of the tubs, along with the plant identification code ""C"". To clarify, products with plant identification code ""J"" were produced in a different facility and are NOT affected by this recall. In addition, Trader Joe's Mediterranean Hummus Snack Pack with Pita Chips (SKU #97136) is NOT part of this recall.
To date there have been no confirmed illnesses.
The potential for contamination was noted after testing by the company revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in product manufactured on the same equipment. The company subsequently identified the source of the issue and has corrected the matter. All potentially affected products have been removed from store shelves and destroyed.
Consumers should discard the product immediately or return it to their point of purchase for a full refund. Customers with questions may contact Bakkavor Foods at (855) 312-7504, Monday through Friday 8:00P.M. - 5:00P.M. PST.

397,2016,12,2,us,FDA Advises Consumers Not to Eat Apple Tree Goat Dairy Goat Cheese Products Because of Possible Listeria Contamination,"Products Test Positive for Listeria Monocytogenes
On this page:
On September 12, 2016, FDA began its inspection of Apple Tree’s manufacturing facility in Richfield, PA. In addition to observing poor sanitation practices, FDA took environmental samples that identified Listeria monocytogenes in 18 environmental samples from Apple Tree’s processing, packaging, and storage areas, including food-contact surfaces such as a cheese slicer, cheese mold, tables, and plates used to hold cheese before packaging. FDA also tested Apple Tree’s goat cheese. Two of the finished goat cheeses and 18 of the environmental samples tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.
On September 20, 2016, Apple Tree initiated a voluntary recall of the four lots of goat cheeses that PDA tested and found positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Later in September, Apple Tree expanded its recall to include all of its goat cheeses, but FDA is not aware of any public notification to consumers announcing the expanded recall. Accordingly, FDA is issuing this release and working with PDA to monitor this situation and take appropriate actions to protect consumers from Apple Tree goat cheeses that may have been exposed to or contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.
Listeriosis is a rare but serious illness usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes. Anyone who experiences fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, or develops fever and chills while pregnant should tell their health care provider about eating a potentially contaminated food. Symptoms can appear from a few days up to a few weeks after consumption of the contaminated food. Read more about food safety tips for expectant mothers: http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/peopleatrisk/ucm083320.htm
Listeriosis, the third leading cause of death from food poisoning, targets pregnant women and their fetuses, people with weakened immune systems, and those 65 years of age or older. Listeriosis hits these high-risk groups the hardest, accounting for at least 90 percent of reported Listeria infections and resulting in higher rates of hospitalization and death than most other foodborne bacteria. In pregnant women, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature labor, and serious illness or death in newborn babies.
Retailers and restaurants should not serve or sell any Apple Tree goat cheeses and should dispose of them. If they do not know the source of their goat cheeses, they should check with their distributor or Apple Tree.
Wash and sanitize display cases and refrigerators where potentially contaminated products were stored.
Wash and sanitize cutting boards, surfaces, and utensils used to cut, serve, or store Apple Tree goat cheeses.
Wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.
Retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any Apple Tree goat cheeses need to be concerned about cross-contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products.
Regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of cutting boards and utensils used in processing may help to minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination.
Listeria can grow at refrigeration temperatures in foods. Listeria can also cross-contaminate other food cut and served on the same cutting board or stored in the same area.
Retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators may wish to consider whether other foods available for sale could have been cross-contaminated from Apple Tree goat cheeses, and should be discarded.
Firms who have re-labeled, re-packed, or used these Apple Tree goat cheeses to produce new products that have not received a thermal kill step should contact the FDA Recall Coordinator in your state to determine whether or not you should initiate a recall of your product(s). FDA District Recall Coordinators for each state are listed at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/IndustryGuidance/ucm129334.htm.
The FDA urges consumers to not eat any Apple Tree goat cheeses, to check their homes for the cheeses, and to throw them away.
To help avoid these goat cheeses contaminating any other foods, consumers should follow these simple steps:
•Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food. •Wash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator, cutting boards and countertops; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; then dry with a clean cloth  or paper towel that has not been previously used. •Wipe-up spills in the refrigerator immediately and clean the refrigerator regularly. •Always wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitization process.  
Additional recommendations for preventing listeriosis are available at the CDC Listeria website: http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/prevention.html.
Consumers with questions may contact the Apple Tree Goat Dairy at 717-694-0146 Monday thru Friday 8:00am to 5:00pm EST.
The FDA also encourages consumers with questions about food safety to call 1-888-SAFEFOOD Monday through Friday between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern time, or to consult the fda.gov website:

408,2016,12,22,us,Herr Foods Inc. Announces Voluntary Recall of Herr’s Brand of Smoked Chipotle Flavored Kettle Cooked Potato Chips and Peddler’s Pantry Smoked Dried Chipotle Kettle Cooked Potato Chips due to Possible Health Risk,"Herr Foods Inc. is announcing a voluntary recall of Smoked Chipotle flavored Kettle Cooked Potato Chips under the Herr’s Brand and Smoke Dried Chipotle flavored Kettle Cooked Potato Chips under the Peddler’s Pantry Brand. These products were flavored with Chipotle seasoning that contained a milk ingredient manufactured by Valley Milk Products LLC. The milk ingredient is being recalled due to a potential risk of Salmonella contamination.
Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the blood stream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis and arthritis.
Although no lab tests have confirmed the presence of Salmonella in these products and no illnesses have been reported, Herr’s is voluntarily issuing an immediate recall of these products in conjunction with FDA guidance with an abundance of caution and with adherence to strict quality standards of Herr Foods Inc.
Product was distributed nationwide through grocery and other retail stores. These products were sold as individual bags. No other ‘Herr’s” products are involved with this recall.
The packages are gold, white and brown metalized bags. The lot number is located on the front of the package in the upper right hand corner. The UPC number is located at the lower right hand corner of the back panel of the package.
Customers and consumers who have purchased the recalled product should not consume them and should return them to the retailer where they were purchased for a full refund. Herr Foods and other retailers are removing recalled product from the retailers’ shelves. As a result, consumers can be assured that all other Herr’s products that remain on-shelf are safe and not subject to this recall. Consumers with questions may call 1-800-523-5030. Live assistance is available 9am- 5pm EST Monday through Friday.

410,2016,12,24,us,"Southeastern Mills, Inc. Announces Recall of Certain Food Ingredients and Food Mixes Due to Possible Health Risk","Rome, GA — Southeastern Mills, Inc. is initiating a voluntary recall of certain quantities of food ingredients and branded food mixes (Southeastern Mills® Biscuit Gravy Mix, Southeastern Mills® Country Biscuit Mix, Southeastern Mills® Buttermilk Drop Biscuit Mix, Southeastern Mills® Easy Drop Cheddar Garlic Drop Biscuit Mix, Shore Lunch® Original Breading and Shore Lunch® Cajun Style Breading) because these ingredients and food mixes contain milk or buttermilk powder purchased from Valley Milk Products, Inc. that is potentially contaminated with Salmonella.
Salmonella is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the United States. This organism can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. Salmonella is killed by proper cooking and pasteurization.
The recalled food ingredients are sold by Southeastern Mills to other food manufacturers and further processed into finished foods sold in various food distribution channels. Southeastern Mills is contacting affected customers directly and providing them with complete details of the items impacted. It is noted that the customer may not need to recall if they have a cooking step validated to kill Salmonella.
The following branded food mixes are also affected by the recall:
Consumers who have purchased these products are urged to discontinue use and return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company by calling 1-800-334-4468, 8 am - 5 pm EST daily or by e-mailing fda@semills.com.

428,2017,3,20,us,"h & b packing co., inc. recalls boneless beef products due to possible e. coli o103 contamination","EDITORS NOTE: This release is being updated to reflect the accurate poundage and description of products included in the recall release issued March 19, 2017.


WASHINGTON, March 19, 2017 – H & B Packing Co., Inc., a Waco, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 79,461 pounds of boneless beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O103, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The boneless beef items were produced on March 6, 2017. The following products are subject to recall:[Label]

60-lb. box containing boneless beef with case code 69029 and production date 03/06/17.

Multiple combo bins containing 73,682-lbs of boneless beef with case code 69029 and production date 03/06/17.

Two combo bins containing 4,095-lb of “Beef Chuck” with case code 73033 and production date 03/06/17.

Combo bin containing 1,624-lb of “Beef 94S Combos” with case code 118078 and production date 3/06/17.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. M13054” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to food manufacturers within the state of Texas.

The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified by the State of Texas’ Meat Safety Assurance Unit about a positive non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli sample.

There have been no confirmed reports of illnesses due to consumption of these products.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in customers' freezers.

Customers who have purchased these products are urged not to use them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground meat that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground meat is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Kris Shirey, H&B Packing Co., Inc., Q.A. supervisor, at (254) 752-2506.

Check to see if you have recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 7914” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to food service locations in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.

The problem was discovered on June 5, 2017 when plant management notified FSIS in-plant inspection personnel of two positives for E. coli O157:H7 test results.

E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that the meat is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Rob Webber, at (1-800-600-8510).

The fully cooked pork sausage patties were produced on August 8, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

2-lb. plastic sleeve packages containing “BREAKFAST Best FULLY COOKED ORIGINAL PORK SAUSAGE PATTIES,” with a sell-by date of 05/15/2018.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 17479T” above the sell by date. These items were shipped to distribution and retail locations in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin.

The problem was discovered when firm’s routine testing indicated positive results for Listeria monocytogenes. The products were on hold at a distribution center, however, the products were inadvertently shipped. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Symptoms in adults can include facial paralysis or loss of facial expression, unreactive or fixed pupils, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, difficulty speaking or including slurred speech, and a change in sound of voice, including hoarseness. Symptoms of foodborne botulism in children can include difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, generalized weakness and paralysis. In all cases, botulism does not cause a fever.

482,2017,10,20,us,BrightFarms Announces Voluntary Regional Recall of Produce Due to Potential Presence of E. coli,"Rochelle, IL. - BrightFarms is initiating a voluntary recall of packaged produce sold in Roundy's Supermarkets due to the potential presence of E. coli at its Rochelle, Illinois (Ogle County) greenhouse farm.
The affected BrightFarms branded products are sold at Mariano's Markets in Illinois and Metro Market and Pick 'n Save stores in Wisconsin.
The recall includes the below salad products packaged in clear, plastic clamshells with best by dates located on the label of the package: 10/24/2017, 10/25/2017, 10/26/2017, 10/27/2017.
Basil products, packaged in clear plastic clamshells with best by dates located on the label of the package: 10/24/2017, 10/25/2017, 10/26/2017, 10/27/2017.
BrightFarms chose to take this action out of an abundance of caution after receiving routine lab results and discovering that certain product may have been compromised. Affected retailers have been instructed to remove all affected products from store shelves.
Although most strains of E. coli are harmless, others may make individuals sick. Some strains of E. coli may create harmful bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration. Seniors, the very young, and persons with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illnesses.
The recall is limited to products grown at the company's Rochelle, Illinois farm. BrightFarms products from greenhouses in other regions are not affected.
Consumers who have purchased the affected products should discard them or return them to their place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions are encouraged to call (646) 480-5262 between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EDT. Consumers can also email info@brightfarms.com with the subject line: Recall.
The quality and safety of our local produce is BrightFarms' top priority. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our consumers and retail customers.",biological,fruits and vegetables,escherichia coli,fresh spinach

Sometimes there will be a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold. Then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). Sometimes foods have to be withdrawn or recalled if there is a risk to consumers because the allergy labelling is missing or incorrect or if there is any other food allergy risk. When there is a food allergy risk, the FSA will issue an Allergy Alert.

484,2017,10,25,us,"Relish Foods, Inc. Recalls Frozen Tuna Loins Because of Possible Health Risk","On October 13, 2017, Relish Foods, Inc. of Culver City, Calif., voluntarily initiated the recall of frozen Newport brand 5 to 8 lb. tuna loins. The recall has since expanded to include: 3 to 5 lb. tuna loins, 6 oz. tuna steaks, and 4 oz. tuna steaks. The recall is the result of sampling by the FDA which revealed that the product has potential to contain the bacteria Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. Relish Foods, Inc. is continuing the investigation with the FDA as to what caused the problem.
Product was distributed in Washington, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, and Texas between 6/17/2017 and 10/13/17 through food service operations, retail stores, and restaurants. Product was distributed as 3 to 5 lb. vacuum-packed, frozen, whole tuna loins packed in 30 lb. Newport brand master cases; 5 to 8 lb. vacuum-packed, frozen, whole tuna loins packed in 30 lb. Newport brand master cases; 6 oz. vacuum-packed tuna steaks in 10 lb. Newport brand master cases; and 4 oz. vacuum-packed tuna steaks in 10 lb. Newport brand master cases. Master cases are labeled with the production lot codes of MTNT 0947C, MTNT 0957B, MTNT 0967A, MTNT 0977D, MTNT 0917B, MTNT 0937D, GND 0737D, GND 0747E, GND 0757A, GND 0767C, GND 0777B, GND 0697B, GND 0707C and GND 0727A.
On the retail side this product would have been distributed to retailers:

Product was distributed to the following retail locations and may have been sold in an unbranded form:
 
 
Product from the recalled lots was displayed at their seafood departments where the product was likely sold as steak loins, or pieces of loins, on a tray with clear plastic wrap cover. It may also have been sold out of the fresh case and wrapped in butcher paper to the customer’s order.
Consumers concerned about whether the tuna they purchased may contain the recalled tuna loin or steak product should check with the store where they purchased the tuna. That store will be able to determine if it used the recalled product to prepare the tuna. At this time Relish Foods does not believe that the recalled product made with the recalled product is available for purchase by consumers.
Customers who purchased the frozen tuna loin (from Yellow Fin tuna) or tuna steak are urged to return it to the retailer for a full refund.
Firms that may have further repackaged, rebranded, or processed these products may be required to further recall product. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-888-730-3875, Mondays through Fridays, 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. (PDT).

485,2017,11,2,us,Chelsea Food Services Firm Recalls Pork and Chicken Products Due To Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 1, 2017 – Chelsea Food Services, doing business as Journey Cuisine, a Denver, Colo. establishment, is recalling approximately 28,064 pounds of pork and chicken burritos and wrap products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ready-to-eat (RTE) pork and chicken burritos and wrap items were produced on various dates from Sept. 11, 2017 through Oct. 26, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)]

8-lb. case containing 16 frozen burritos of “KING Soopers BACON BREAKFAST BURRITO” with “Sell By” dates from 03/11/18 to 4/26/18.

8-lb. case containing 16 frozen burritos of “KING Soopers CARNITAS POTATO BURRITO (Burrito Carnitas Caliente)” with “Sell By” dates from 03/11/18 to 4/26/18.

8-lb. case containing 16 frozen burritos of “KING Soopers CHICKEN QUESO BURRITO” with “Sell By” dates from 03/11/18 to 4/26/18.

8-lb. case containing 16 frozen burritos of “KING Soopers SPICY SAUSAGE BURRITO (Burrito Spicy Breakfast)” with “Sell By” dates from 03/11/18 to 4/26/18.

4-lb. case containing 8 sandwich kits of “SHAMROCK FOODS GRILLED CHICKEN WRAP” with “Use By” dates from 9/16/17 to 10/31/17.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 19822” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.

Journey Cuisine notified FSIS on Oct. 30, 2017 that one of its products, Burrito Carnitas Caliente, had tested positive for L. monocytogenes during the firm’s product testing. After a review of the ingredients used in the Burrito Carnitas Caliente, the company determined that four additional products may be affected. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Members of the media with questions regarding the recall can contact Journey Cuisine’s media relations at (872) 825-8640. Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact the company at (866) 596-2385.

Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov.

The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) immediately contacted the sole agent of Lactalis in Hong Kong, major local importers and retailers to follow up. Preliminary investigations showed that the products concerned had not been imported or sold in Hong Kong. The CFS issued a food incident post to inform local trade of the incident on December 4. - Following the French authorities' announcement on December 10 that the recall of products by Lactalis has been extended to cover all products produced by one processing plant (Lactalis Craon Factory) since February 15, 2017, the CFS has been proactively following up on the incident. CFS' investigation showed that the importer concerned had imported about 28 000 cartons of the affected products and some of them had been distributed for sale. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety - The CFS has instructed the importer concerned to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected batches of the products, and recall the products concerned. - The remaining stock in the importer's warehouse has been immediately marked and sealed by the CFS. In addition, 15 000 cartons are being shipped to Hong Kong which will also be marked and sealed by the CFS on their arrival. - The CFS has enhanced surveillance of dairy products available in local market since the incident. - The CFS will continue to closely monitor the latest development of the incident and take appropriate follow-up action. Advice to the Trade - Stop selling the products concerned immediately if they possess them.

502,2018,1,29,us,Panera Bread Preemptively Recalls All 2 oz. and 8 oz. Cream Cheese Products,"While there have been no reported illnesses, out of an abundance of caution, Panera Bread is conducting a nationwide preemptive, voluntary recall of all 2 oz. and 8 oz. cream cheese products sold in its U.S. bakery-cafes. This recall was initiated after samples of one variety of 2 oz. cream cheese from a single production day showed a positive result for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Tests on cream cheese samples manufactured both before and after the production run in question have all come back negative.
Despite the finding in only one day of production, Panera Bread is issuing a voluntary recall of all varieties of the 2 oz. and 8 oz. cream cheese. The products included in the recall are all varieties (see below) of unexpired 2 oz. and 8 oz. cream cheese products with an expiration date on or before 4/2/18. This recall only affects cream cheese sold in Panera Bread United States bakery cafes and does not affect Panera Bread Canadian bakery cafes or any other Panera Bread food products.
“The safety of our guests and associates is paramount, therefore we are recalling all cream cheese products sold in the US with an active shelf life. We have likewise ceased all manufacturing in the associated cream cheese facility,” said Blaine Hurst, Panera’s President and CEO. “Only one variety of 2-oz cream cheese from a single day yielded the positive result. Our intent is to go above and beyond for our guests. You should expect nothing less from Panera.”
According to the FDA, Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-21011” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to Fareway grocery stores in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota.

On February 9, 2018, FSIS was notified by health officials in Iowa of an investigation of Salmonella Typhimurium illnesses. The Iowa Department of Public Health, Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals, and Iowa State Hygienic Laboratory determined that there is a link between the chicken salad from Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. and this outbreak. Based on epidemiological investigation, 37 confirmed case-patients have been identified in Iowa, with illness onset dates ranging from January 14, 2018 to February 6, 2018. Results are pending on whether the outbreak strain is resistant to antibiotics. The Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals and Department of Public Health issued a joint Consumer Advisory Issued for Chicken Salad Purchased at Fareway grocery stores on February 13, 2018, advising consumers to throw away any remaining chicken salad product. The chicken salad product subject to recall was purchased from January 4, 2018 to February 9, 2018 in various weight containers from the deli sections in Fareway grocery stores.

FSIS continues to work with state and federal health officials to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to this product, including illnesses in states outside of Iowa. This product was sold at Fareway grocery stores in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota. FSIS will provide updated information as it becomes available.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume chicken salad that has been cooked to a temperature of 165° F. The only way to confirm that chicken salad is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Sulphur dioxide and/or sulphites These products contain sulphur dioxide making them a possible health risk for anyone with a sensitivity to sulphur dioxide and/or sulphites.
If you have bought either of the above products and have a sensitivity to sulphur dioxide and/or sulphites, do not eat them. Instead return them to the store from where they were bought for a full refund.
C&K Meats Ltd is recalling the above products from customers and has been advised to contact the relevant allergy support organisations, which will tell their members about the recall.

These notices explain to customers why the products are being recalled and tell them what to do if they have bought the products. Please see the attached notice.
Sometimes there will be a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold. Then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). Sometimes foods have to be withdrawn or recalled if there is a risk to consumers because the allergy labelling is missing or incorrect or if there is any other food allergy risk. When there is a food allergy risk, the FSA will issue an Allergy Alert.

516,2018,3,22,us,PDX Aromatics Issues Second Expanded Recall of Kratom Products Because of Possible Health Risk,"PDX Aromatics, DBA Kraken Kratom, Phytoextractum, and Soul Speciosa, is again expanding the scope of their 3/9/2018 and 3/15/2018 voluntary recalls to include certain red vein and green vein kratom powder and capsule products because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. The second expanded recall is being initiated in response to additional positive findings of Salmonella associated with PDX Aromatics’ products following the FDA’s investigation.
To date the company is aware of four confirmed cases of Salmonella associated with consumption of red and white vein products.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The expanded recall includes certain red vein powder and capsule products shipped between 12/1/2017 and 3/8/2018 and certain green vein powder and capsule products shipped between 9/18/2017 and 11/1/2017 and between 2/9/2018 and 3/8/2018.
The expanded recalled products were sold directly to internet consumers in the US through the company websites http://phytoextractum.com; http://soulspeciosa.com; and http://krakenkratom.com.
Recalled products were sold to two customers in the United Kingdom and to one customer in each of the following countries: Ireland, Japan, Norway, and Turkey.

The company is thoroughly communicating the details of the recall and is notifying all customers to return products so they can be destroyed. Any customer who believes they may have product affected by this recall should visit pdxaromatics.com/recall for complete return and refund instructions.

518,2018,3,27,us,First Source Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Peanuts in Wegmans 9 Oz Yogurt Raisins,"First Source of Tonawanda, NY, is voluntarily recalling 9 OZ packages of Wegmans Yogurt Raisins, because the product may contain undeclared peanuts. People who have an allergy or sensitivity to peanuts run the risk of serious or life- threatening allergic reaction if they consume this product.
The recalled retail packaged item is as follows:
These products were distributed at Wegmans Stores in the following states MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, and VA, The affected product was sold from January 16, 2018 to present.

520,2018,3,29,us,"Target Corporation Recalls Frozen Ready-To-Eat and Non-Ready-To-Eat Meat and Poultry Products due to Possible Temperature Abuse During Transport at a Single Store on Oahu, Honolulu, HI","WASHINGTON, March 29, 2018 – Target Corporation, located in Minneapolis, Minn.is recalling an undetermined amount of frozen ready-to-eat and not-ready-to-eat meat and poultry products due to temperature abuse during transport, which may have resulted in the growth of spoilage organisms or pathogens, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. Temperature abuse, during which the product was at temperatures greater than 60°F for over five hours, may result in the growth of the proliferation of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella. The frozen ready-to-eat and not-ready-to-eat meat and poultry items were sold from March 23, 2018 to March 27, 2018. The complete list of products, product labels and UPC code numbers can be found here. These items were shipped to one Target retail store in Hawaii located at 1450 Ala Moana Blvd, Ste 2401, Honolulu, HI 96814. The problem was discovered on March 27, 2018 when the company received temperature records of the shipment from the carrier. All inventory of the impacted items have been removed from the store and destroyed. Target notified FSIS that the product from the shipping container had been temperature abused on March 28, 2018.

Emetic toxins produced by Bacillus cereus are characterizeed by nausea and vomiting occurring within 30 minutes to six hours after consumption of contaminated foods. Staphylococcus aureusis a common bacteria found on the skin and in the noses of healthy people and animals.Staphylococcus aureuscan produce seven different toxins that are frequently responsible for food poisoning. Most people infected with E.coli develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Some kinds of E. coli bacteria cause disease when they make a toxin called Shiga toxin. The bacteria that make these toxins are called “Shiga toxin-producing E. coli,” or STEC for short. The most common type of STEC in the United States is E.coli O157:H7. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. Consumption of food contaminated withSalmonellacan cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

525,2018,4,6,us,Advocare Issues Allergy Alert in Select Bottles of Muscle Strength and Nighttime Recovery Product Because of Undeclared Milk Allergen on The Label,"AdvoCare International has commenced a voluntary recall of two lots of Muscle Strength and four lots of Nighttime Recovery dietary supplements because they may contain undeclared milk that can elicit an allergic reaction in individuals who are sensitive to milk and milk products.
Individuals who are highly sensitive to milk protein who consumed caplets from these lots may experience symptoms common to a milk allergy including gastrointestinal issues or allergenic skin reactions. Even in those instances involving more intense reactions, any anticipated effects are expected to resolve quickly and typically do not require medical treatment.
Product was distributed nationwide through AdvoCare and our Independent Distributors. Affected product includes 15,640 units of Muscle Strength, Product code: P3221 with lot numbers: 7063341, 7082161, and sold between November 15, 2017 - March 29, 2018 and 48,176 units of Nighttime Recovery, Product code: P3201 lot numbers: 7081841, 7063321, 7052411, 7090471, sold between December 15, 2017 - March 28, 2018.
No reports of adverse events due to a milk allergen had been reported prior to the recall.
As part of a routine formula review, a prospective manufacturer indicated the presence of milk in Ashwagandha, a raw ingredient common to both Muscle Strength and Nighttime Recovery. After AdvoCare was alerted to the possibility of trace amounts of milk in both products, we immediately conducted an investigation and engaged a third-party health hazard evaluation. The investigation concluded that Ashwagandha was extracted using milk. Therefore, trace amounts of milk can be detected in these specific lots. The risk of a mild or severe adverse reaction exists but is extremely low (i.e., less than 0.5% of the adult population). AdvoCare suspended sales of Nighttime Recovery and Muscle Strength while issuing the voluntary recall. Communications were sent to all Distributors and Customers who purchased the affected product through the AdvoCare website. Distributors were instructed to contact any customer to whom they sold the product in-person using the sample email communication.
If you purchased any of the affected product, AdvoCare is urging consumers to call Customer Service at 1-800- 542-4800 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mon - Fri for a full refund or exchange of the product.",allergens,herbs and spices,milk and products thereof,dried herb powder ashwagandha (withania somnifera)

531,2018,4,17,us,"Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. Announces Voluntary Shell Egg Recall Due to Possible Health Risk","Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM) today announced the Company was notified after the close of business on April 13, 2018, by Rose Acre Farms of Seymour, Indiana, of a voluntary egg recall. The eggs involved in the recall have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella Braenderup and were distributed from Rose Acre Farms’ Hyde County, North Carolina, facility from January 11, 2018, through April 12, 2018. Salmonella Braenderup can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals infected with Salmonella Braenderup can experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella Braenderup can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Through an abundance of caution, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is voluntarily recalling one load, or 23,400 dozen eggs, purchased from Rose Acre Farms and re-packaged at the Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.’s Dade City, Florida, location. The product will list the plant number of P-1359D, and will have a Julian date of either 048A or 049A and a best by date of April 2, 2018, or April 3, 2018.
All customers that received these eggs from Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. have been notified of the recall. No illnesses have been reported to date.
The potentially affected eggs being recalled by Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. are listed below. Plant numbers and Julian dates can be found printed on the individual boxes. The Julian date follows the plant number, for example P-1359D-048A. These eggs were distributed in the state of Florida.
This is a consumer level recall. Consumers who believe they may have purchased potentially affected shell eggs should not eat them but should return them to the store where they were purchased. Questions and concerns may be directed to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.’s corporate office at 1-888-254-4465, (extension 4387 on the Company’s voicemail system) between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Standard time.

Two products were previously recalled due to elevated levels of copper (details can be found in FSA-PRIN-27-2108 issued on 11 May 2018). Since that recall, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS) have made concerted efforts to ascertain an accurate understanding of the Rolkem products range and requested a number of ingredient details from Rolkem to confirm their suitability for use in food.

557,2018,7,17,us,Hy-Vee Voluntarily Recalls Spring Pasta Salad Due to Reported Illnesses,"Hy-Vee, Inc., based in West Des Moines, Iowa, is voluntarily recalling its Hy-Vee Spring Pasta Salad due to the potential that it may be contaminated with Salmonella. The potential for contamination was brought to Hy-Vee’s attention last night when approximately 20 illnesses in Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa were potentially linked back to customers consuming the salad. The voluntary recall includes Hy-Vee Spring Pasta Salads in both 1 pound (16 oz.) and 3 pound (48 oz.) containers produced between June 1, 2018, and July 13, 2018, and available from the deli service case.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
The pasta salad was distributed to all of Hy-Vee’s 244 grocery stores across its eight-state region of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The product comes in a plastic container with a plastic lid. The expiration date range is between June 22, 2018, and Aug. 3, 2018. The expiration date can be found on the side of the container.
Out of an abundance of caution, Hy-Vee voluntarily removed the product last night from all of its shelves and service cases as soon as the grocery chain was notified about the situation.
Customers who purchased this product should dispose of it or return it to their local Hy-Vee store for a full refund.

566,2018,8,15,us,Zakah Life Recalls Kratom Because Of Possible Health Risk,"Zakah Life, LLC of Ankeny, Iowa, is recalling the following Kratom products (Super Green Maeng Da Premium Kratom powder, Powerful Red Vein Bali Premium Kratom powder, Super Green Maeng Da Premium Kratom capsules, and Powerful Red Vein Bali Premium Kratom capsules) with expiration dates prior to 01/01/2023 because they have the potential of being contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.

The recalled Kratom products were distributed nationwide in retail stores and through mail orders.
The affected products, lot, best by dates and packaging are as follows:
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The potential for contamination was noted after laboratory testing revealed the presence of Salmonella in some packages of Super Green Maeng Da Kratom powder, Red Powder Vein Bali Kratom powder, Super Green Maeng Da Premium Kratom capsules, and Powerful Red Vein Bali Premium Kratom capsules.
Production of the product has been suspended while the FDA and the company continue their investigation as to the source of the problem.
Consumers who have purchased Super Green Maeng Da Kratom powder, Red Powder Vein Bali Kratom powder, Super Green Maeng Da Premium Kratom capsules, and Powerful Red Vein Bali Premium Kratom capsules are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

580,2018,9,26,us,mauna loa macadamia nut corporation voluntarily recalls,"KEAAU, HI (September 24, 2018) – Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation is voluntarily recalling all of its products produced at the Keaau facility between Sept. 6 - 21, 2018 due to a potential contamination of Escherichia coli (E. coli). The recall was initiated due to E.coli being detected in the well water and distribution system that supplies the firm’s operations. No illnesses related to the water have been reported to the state.
Mauna Loa is voluntarily recalling their products out of an abundance of caution under the advisement of the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH).
E. coli bacteria can exist in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate soil and may persist in soil for a number of years. E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
On Sept. 21, 2018 DOH notified Mauna Loa that a water sample in their distribution system was positive for E. coli. It was thought that a possible reason for contamination was the result of a disinfection system malfunction.
Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation took immediate action to notify employees and the public within 24 hours of receiving notification from DOH of the possibility of contamination. It was advised that the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Water System consumers and employees NOT drink/consume the water while investigations continued.
Subsequent test samples remained positive for E.coli and the State DOH has advised Mauna Loa to recall its products as an additional safety measure. The firm has been closed since Sept. 21, 2018 and will remain closed until the water clears State DOH drinking water standards. The DOH has been in constant communication with Mauna Loa regarding the issue to ensure all safety standards are being met.
The products, produced between Sept. 6 - 21, 2018, and listed on the following pages are being recalled due to possible contamination with E. coli.
Product Recall Information:
The above products were packaged in Keaau, Hawaii and sold only in retail stores in Hawaii. Consumers who have purchased the recalled products should discard the products immediately or attempt to return them to the store where purchased.
Mauna Loa is committed to the highest industry standards and is working diligently to determine the cause of the contamination. The facility has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safety and quality and is reviewing its process thoroughly to avoid any future contamination issues. Mauna Loa utilizes the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) management system as one of the ways it addresses food safety. It is also fully compliant with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act).
General guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available from the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1(800) 426-4791.
If you have any questions, please call 1(844) 344-5444, Monday – Friday, 8am-4pm HST. This is a toll-free number.
News media with specific inquiries should contact, Mia Noguchi via email mia@lotuspondcomm.com or phone at (808) 551-1649.

586,2018,10,18,us,Hy-Vee Voluntarily Recalls Several Meat and Potato Products,"Hy-Vee, Inc., based in West Des Moines, Iowa, is voluntarily recalling six of its meat and potato products across its eight-state region due to possible contamination with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. The potential for contamination was discovered after Hy-Vee's supplier, McCain Foods, announced it was recalling its caramelized mushrooms and fire-roasted tomatoes, which are ingredients that are used in six Hy-Vee products. To date, no illnesses have been reported in connection with these products.
Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
Out of an abundance of caution, Hy-Vee is recalling the following products from all of its stores:
All impacted products have a ""Best If Used By"" date of Oct. 22, 2018, or sooner.
Customers who purchased any of these products with these dates should not consume them. Customers are being asked to discard these items or return them to their local Hy-Vee store for a full refund.

Issues Recall Due to Elevated Lead in Spices","Sirob Imports, Inc of Lindenhurst, NY is recalling, Corrado, Orlando Imports, Nouri’s Syrian Bakery, Mediterranean Specialty Foods Brand and Butera Fruit Market Curry Powder because it contains elevated levels of lead.
Lead is a toxic substance present in our environment in small amounts and everyone is exposed to some lead from daily actions such as inhaling dust, eating food, or drinking water. In general, the small exposure to lead within the U.S. population does not pose a significant public health concern.
However, exposure to larger amounts of lead can cause lead poisoning. While lead can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, weakness, behavior or mood changes, delirium, seizures, and coma. However, infants, young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of lead that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with lead poisoning may not look or act sick. Lead poisoning in children can cause: learning disabilities, developmental delays, and lower IQ scores.
The curry powder was distributed direct to the following states IL, NJ, and NY.
The curry powder is packaged in 8 oz. and 16 oz. plastic containers and labeled with the following band names:
Corrado 16 oz. – UPC: 0 12729 01100 7 8 oz. – UPC: 0 12729 01102 1

No illnesses have been reported to date.
The recall was initiated after FDA sampling found elevated levels of lead in the product. The product sampling was conducted as a result of a consumer complaint regarding elevated blood lead levels in a child. The recalled product has not been definitively linked to this event but the investigation is ongoing.
Consumers should not consume this product. Consumers who have purchased curry from Corrados, Orlando Imports, Nouri’s Syrian Bakery, and Mediterranean Specialty Foods are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

602,2018,12,21,us,"Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales, Inc. Recalls Raw Ground Turkey Products due to Possible Salmonella Reading Contamination","EDITOR’S NOTE:FSIS and our public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health officials, are investigating a Salmonella Reading outbreak. A previous recall of raw ground turkey products associated with the outbreak occurred on Nov. 15, 2018. Please note that FSIS is continuing to investigate illnesses associated with this widespread outbreak, and additional product from other companies may also be recalled. Salmonella is prevalent and can be present in raw poultry and meat – no raw poultry or meat is sterile. In addition to discarding the product associated with this recall, consumers can protect themselves now and in the future by ALWAYS cooking their turkey, and other poultry products thoroughly, to a safe internal temperature of 165 ℉, as measured using a food thermometer. The cooking process kills the Salmonella. No one should be eating partially cooked or raw turkey. Additionally, it is essential that people wash their hands after handling raw poultry, meat, and pet food to avoid cross contamination.
		

WASHINGTON, Dec. 21, 2018 – Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales, Inc., a Faribault, Minn. establishment, is recalling approximately 164,210 pounds of raw ground turkey products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Reading, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The raw ground turkey items were produced on October 22, 2018 and October 23, 2018. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

3-lb. packages of “Jennie-O GROUND TURKEY 93% LEAN | 7% FAT” with “Use or freeze by” dates of 11/12/18 and 11/13/18 on the side of the trays.
	1-lb. packages of “Jennie-O GROUND TURKEY 93% LEAN | 7% FAT” with “Use or freeze by” dates of 11/12/18 on the side of the trays.
	1-lb. packages of “Jennie-O TACO SEASONED GROUND TURKEY” with “Use or freeze by” dates of 11/12/18 on the side of the trays.
	1-lb. packages of “Jennie-O ITALIAN SEASONED GROUND TURKEY” with “Use or freeze by” dates of 11/12/18 on the side of the trays.
	3-lb. packages of “Jennie-O Ground Turkey 85% LEAN | 15% FAT” with a “Use or freeze by” date of 11/13/18 on the side of the trays.
	2.5-lb. packages of “Jennie-O Ground Turkey 93% LEAN | 7% FAT” with a “Use or freeze by” date of 11/13/18 on the side of the trays.
	3-lb. packages of “STATER BROS. 85% LEAN | 15% FAT ALL NATURAL Ground Turkey” with a “Use or freeze by” date of 11/12/18 on the side of the trays.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. P-579” inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the side of the tray. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

FSIS and its public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, have been conducting traceback activities for a sample of Jennie-O brand ground turkey in an intact, unopened package from a case-patient’s home. The patient tested positive for Salmonella Reading and the samples from the case-patient and from the ground turkey are closely related genetically.

This investigation is part of a larger effort involving FSIS, the CDC, and state public health and agriculture partners, who have been working together on an illness cluster involving 216 case-patients in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Patients have reported eating different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different stores, handling raw turkey pet food and/or raw turkey, or working with live turkeys or living with someone who handled live turkeys. FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state health and agriculture departments on this larger investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. Based on the continuing investigation, additional product from other companies may also be recalled.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw poultry product that has been cooked to a temperature of 165°F. Safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential in preventing foodborne illness. You can't see, smell, or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness. In every step of food preparation, follow the four guidelines to keep food safe:

Clean—Wash hands and surfaces often.
	Separate—Separate raw meat from other foods.
	Cook—Cook to the right temperature.
	Chill—Refrigerate food promptly.
Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Hormel Consumer Engagement, at (800) 621-3505. Media with questions regarding the recall can contact Media Relations at, media@hormel.com or (507) 434 6352.

Recalls Venison Sausage Products Due to Mislabeling,"WASHINGTON, April 10, 2019 – Yoakum Packing Co., a Yoakum, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 12,388 pounds of smoked venison sausage that contains pork products that were not represented on the label, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The fully cooked smoked venison sausage containing beef, pork and other nonmeat products items were produced from May 3, 2017 through March 22, 2019. The following products are subject to recall:[View Labels(PDF only)]

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 2216” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors and retailers in the state of Texas.

The problem was discovered during routine labeling verification by FSIS on April 10, 2019.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ and retailers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Page 1 of 2 
 
Recall of ""Crottin De Pays"" Goat Cheese from France 
 
The European Commission Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) 
has issued a notification that 2 batches of “Crottin De Pays” Goat Cheese from France 
have been recalled due to high count of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. 
 
2 As there is import of the implicated product into Singapore, the Singapore 
Food Agency (SFA) has directed the importer to recall the product. The implicated 
goat cheeses have not been distributed to the market for sale, and are stored in the 
importer’s warehouse.  
 
Unpasteurised milk cheese 
3      Consumers who choose to consume unpasteurised milk cheese must be aware 
of the risks involved. Unpasteurised milk is likely to contain more bacteria and other 
pathogens compared to pasteurised milk. This may include E. coli bacteria, which can 
cause food poisoning. As a precaution, vulnerable groups of people, especially young 
children, pregnant women, elderly persons, or people with chronic illness such as 
diabetes, should avoid consuming unpasteurised food products. Consumers who do 
not feel well after consumption of unpasteurised milk cheese should seek medical 
attention. 
 
4      The key to preventing foodborne illnesses lies in good food hygiene and food 
safety practices. Consumers are advised to: 
 Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources; 
 Keep raw food separate from vegetables, fruits, cooked and ready-to-eat food; 
 Avoid unpasteurised milk or foods made from unpasteurised milk; 
 Wash hands, utensils, or food preparation surfaces before and after handling 
raw food.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. The recalled Fennel Seed Whole was sold directly to customers who ordered from mountainroseherbs.com, purchased at the company’s retail shop in Eugene, Oregon, or placed mail orders by phone or fax. The affected product was also distributed to vitamin and health food stores in AZ, CA, CO, FL, IL, MA, MI, MN, MT, NC, NE, NM, NY, OH, OR, PA, SC, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WV and to one consignee in Canada. It is possible MRH customers also resold the Fennel Seed Whole to their own clientele. The product comes in a clear plastic or poly-woven bag marked with lot # 25031, which is located on the principal display panel on the lower left of the label. Product has been sold and distributed between April 2019 and up to July 18, 2019. No illnesses have been reported to date.

720,2019,11,16,us,"central valley meat co., inc. recalls ground beef products due to possible salmonella dublin contamination","EDITOR’S NOTE:FSIS and our public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health officials, are investigating a Salmonella Dublin outbreak. Please note that FSIS is continuing to investigate illnesses associated with this outbreak and their sources and additional product may be recalled.


WASHINGTON, Nov. 15, 2019 – Central Valley Meat Co., Inc., a Hanford, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 34,222 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Dublin, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The ground beef items were produced on July 23, 2019. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF only)]

1-lb. chub packages of “STATER BROS. 100% PURE GROUND BEEF 96% LEAN 4% FAT” with lot 2049 on the retail label; lot 19204 on the case label; and Use By 08-14-19.

2-lb. chub packages of “STATER BROS. 100% PURE GROUND BEEF 93% LEAN 7% FAT” with lot 2049 on the retail label; lot 19204 on the case label; and Use By 08-14-19.

20-lb. cases containing “STATER BROS 93/7 Ground Beef 10# Chub 10 Lb. Chubs/ 2 Count” with lot 19204 on the case label and Use By 08-14-19.
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 6063A” printed on the retail labels next to the lot number and inside the USDA mark of inspection on the case labels. These items were shipped to retail locations in California.

FSIS was notified of an investigation of Salmonella Dublin illnesses on September 9, 2019. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and state and local public health partners, FSIS determined that there is a link between ground beef products from Central Valley Meat Co., Inc., and this illness cluster. The traceback investigation indicated that a case-patient consumed ground beef produced by Central Valley Meat Co., Inc. Based on epidemiological investigation, 10 case-patients have been identified in 6 states with illness onset dates ranging from August 8, 2019 to September 22, 2019. Additional information may be found on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/dublin-11-19/index.html. This outbreak strain of Salmonella Dublin did not identify any antibiotic resistance. FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state and local public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, https://www.fsis.usda.gov/safetempchart.

  FSIS Issues Public Health Alert for Raw Beef Ravioli Products Due to Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert because approximately 70 pounds of raw beef ravioli products, produced by P&S Ravioli Company, a Philadelphia, Pa. establishment, may be contaminated withE. coliO157:H7. A recall was not requested because the affected product is no longer available for purchase.
However, FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products should not consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
The frozen, raw ground beef ravioli items were produced on April 30, 2020. The following product is subject to the public health alert:
13-oz. boxes containing “P&S RAVOLI COMPANY 12 JUMBO MEAT RAVIOLI” with a use-by date of 11/30/2020 and lot code 20121.
The products bear establishment number “EST. 2736” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a limited number of retail locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The problem was discovered when P&S Ravioli Company was notified by their third-party laboratory that a sample was positive forE. coliO157:H7, but the products associated with the sample had already been shipped into commerce. The establishment notified FSIS of the sampling results and subsequently controlled all product remaining for sale.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.
E. coliO157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.
FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw ground beef product that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°F. The only way to confirm that frozen raw ground beef ravioli products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures safe internal temperature.

  FSIS Issues Public Health Alert for Ready to Eat Sausage Products due to Possible Listeria Contamination
  




          Blue Grass Provisions Co. Inc.
    

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, Aug. 7, 2020– The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert because Bluegrass Provisions Co., a Crescent Springs, Ky. establishment, produced sausage products that may be contaminated withListeria monocytogenes. A recall was not requested because it is believed that all products are no longer in commerce and are past their use or freeze by dates.
The ready-to-eat smoked sausage items were produced on Apr. 22, 2020. The following products subject to the public health alert are:
14-oz. plastic packages containing 6 pieces of “BLUE GRASS METTWURST,” with a use or freeze by date of July 23, 2020.
14-oz. plastic packages containing 6 pieces of “WALNUT CREEK FOODS Smoked Sausage,” with a use or freeze by date of July 23, 2020.
14-oz. plastic packages containing 6 pieces of Lidl “SMOKED BRATWURST,” with a use or freeze by date of July 23, 2020.
14-oz. plastic packages containing 6 pieces of Lidl “SMOKED BRATWURST WITH CHEESE,” with a use or freeze by date of July 23, 2020.
The products bear establishment number “EST. 7417” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations in Kentucky, Ohio, North Carolina, and Virginia.
The problem was discovered by routine testing and the results showed one of the products was contaminated withListeria monocytogenes.The additional products may be affected by cross-contamination.
Consumption of food contaminated withL. monocytogenescan cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.
Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. The recall was voluntarily initiated after the company’s routine internal testing identified Listeria monocytogenes on a piece of equipment in one of our packing facilities. We have ceased the production and distribution of the product that was packed on the equipment in question and are taking corrective actions and continually evaluating our cleaning and sanitation regimes. No illnesses have been associated with this recall to date. Consumers can identify recalled retail products by looking for the brand, UPC number and, if available the trace number printed on the tag or clip attached to the opening end of the bag. The recalled products were shipped directly to retailer distribution centers in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia and to wholesalers in Maryland and North Carolina (see table below).  Consumers who have a recalled item listed above in their possession should not consume it and should destroy the product in a way so that it may not be consumed by others or return it to the place of purchase for a refund. Consumers with questions may contact Freshouse II, LLC at 631-369-7150, Monday through Friday: 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Eastern Time.

  FSIS Issues Public Health Alert for Raw Ground Beef Product Due to Possible E. Coli O157:H7 Contamination
  
  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert because raw beef product produced by Greater Omaha Packing Co. Inc., an Omaha, Neb. establishment, may be contaminated withE. coli.O157:H7. A recall was not requested because the affected product is no longer available for purchase.
FSIS is concerned that some ground beef products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products should not consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
The raw beef item was produced by Greater Omaha Packing Co. Inc. on January 14, 2021, further processed into ground beef and sold by Art’s Food Market located in Sandwich, Illinois. The following product is subject to the public health alert:
2-lb (approximately) trays containing raw ground beef labeled with a retail label with “PACKED” dates ranging from JAN 28 2021 through JAN 31 2021.
This item was sold by the single retail location in Sandwich, Illinois.
The problem was discovered when Greater Omaha Packing Co. Inc. determined that they inadvertently distributed product associated with a sample that was positive forE. coliO157:H7. The company then notified FSIS about the affected product.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.
E. coliO157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.
FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw ground beef product that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°F. The only way to confirm that raw ground beef products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature,https://www.fsis.usda.gov/safetempchart.
Consumers and members of the media with questions about the public health alert can contactAngel Besta, VP of Technical Resources,Greater Omaha Packing Co. Inc. atabesta@greateromahs.com.
Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat viaAsk USDAfrom 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages atAsk USDAor send a question via email toMPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day athttps://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.

   FSIS Issues Public Health Alert for Beef Meatball Products Due to Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen
  
  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert because Whole Foods Market, Inc., sold an undetermined amount of beef meatballs with marinara sauce that were misbranded and were produced with an undeclared allergen. The products contain parmesan cheese made from milk, which is a known allergen, and is not declared on the product label. FSIS is issuing this public health alert out of the utmost of caution to ensure that consumers with allergic reactions to milk are aware that these products should not be consumed. A recall was not requested because it is believed that the affected products are no longer available to be directly purchased by retail consumers.
The beef meatballs with marinara sauce products subject to the public health alert are:
24-oz. clear plastic containers of “Whole Foods Market Beef Meatballs with Marinara” with a PLU code of 39496 and sell-by dates through 2/27/21.
This product was soldin retail locations in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin.
The problem was discovered when the firm notified FDA of a customer report of an adverse reaction due to consumption of the product. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers with food allergies who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
Consumers and members of the media with questions about the public health alert can contact Nathan Cimbala, Global Public Relations, Whole Foods Market, Inc., at nathan.cimbala@wholefoods.com.
Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov.

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            EDITOR’S NOTE:FSIS updated the release the same day of issue to reflect product poundage.
WASHINGTON, April 2, 2021 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert for for approximately 39 pounds of raw ground chorizo sausage products due to concerns that the products may be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically hard pieces of crystalline material. FSIS is issuing this public health alert out of the utmost of caution to ensure that consumers are aware that these products should not be consumed. A recall was not requested because it is believed that the products are no longer available for consumers to purchase.
The fresh and frozen raw ground chorizo sausage items were produced on March 8, 2021 by Century Oak Packing Company, an establishment in Mt. Angel, Ore. The following product is subject to the public health alert:
1-lb. packages containing “Lonely Lane Farms Family Farm Since 1939 OREGON RAISED Chorizo Sausage” and product ID 21067-6.
The products bear establishment number “EST. M40256” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were sold at a farmer’s market and also shipped to retail locations in Oregon.                
The problem was discovered when the firm received three consumer complaints reporting findings of hard pieces of crystalline material in the product.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers or both. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
Consumers with questions can contact Century Oak Packing at 503-845-4180. Members of the media with questions about the public health alert can contact Evelyn Shop, Media and Communications Director at Century Oak Packing at (718) 772-2350.

  FSIS Issues Public Health Alert for Raw Ground Turkey Products Linked to Salmonella Hadar Illness
  




          Plainville Brands, LLC
    

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            Editor’s notes: On April 12, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a food safety alert for the Salmonella Hadar outbreak linked to ground turkey.

This public health alert was updated on April 12, 2021 to reflect the recent change made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the incubation period for Salmonella. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever which may begin within 6 hours to 6 days after infection.

WASHINGTON, APRIL 10, 2021 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert for approximately 211,406 pounds of raw ground turkey products, produced by Plainville Brands, LLC, a Pennsylvania establishment, due to concerns the products may have caused Salmonella Hadar illness. A recall was not requested because it is believed that the products are no longer available for consumers to purchase.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. Retail locations that may receive returned product from consumers should destroy this product immediately.

The raw ground turkey products were produced on December 18, 2020 through December 29, 2020. The following products are subject to the public health alert:

1-lb. packages of Nature’s Promise Free from 94% LEAN | 6% FAT Ground Turkey with Use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/1/21, 1/3/21,1/4/21, 1/8/21 and 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
	1-lb. packages of Wegman 94% LEAN | 6% FAT Ground Turkey with Use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/3/21, 1/4/21, 1/8/21 and 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
	3-lb. packages of Wegman 94% LEAN | 6% FAT Ground Turkey with Use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/3/21, 1/4/21, 1/8/21 and 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
	1-lb. packages of Plainville Farms Ground White Turkey 93% | 7% Fat with Use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
The products bear establishment number EST. P-244 inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

FSIS and its public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), public health and regulatory officials are investigating a multistate outbreak of 28 Salmonella Hadar illnesses in 12 states with onset dates ranging from December 28, 2020 through March 4, 2021. The traceback investigation for one case patient identified the patient consumed ground turkey produced by Plainville Brands, LLC. An intact, unopened package of Plainville Brands’ ground turkey collected from this case-patient’s home tested positive for Salmonella Hadar and was closely related genetically to the sample from the patient. Evidence collected to date does not link all illnesses to this establishment. Based on the continuing investigation, additional product from other establishments may be involved. FSIS continues to work with CDC and state and local public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within6 hours to 6 daysafter eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw ground turkey that has been cooked to a temperature of 165°F. The only way to confirm the poultry item is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, https://www.fsis.usda.gov/safetempchart.

Consumers and members of the media with questions about the public health alert can contact Yusef Robb at (323)384-1789 or by email at yusef@tkCommunicationsLLC.com.

Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.

923,2021,10,7,us,Urgent Bean and Soy Sprout Voluntary Recall,"The purpose of this announcement is to advise you that Fullei Fresh is voluntarily recalling Bean Sprouts and Soy Sprouts as a precaution due to possible exposure to listeria monocytogenes.

In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more sever illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e. infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

The items being recalled are: Haddock, Monkfish, Bone-in Trout, Grouper, Red Snapper, Red Rock Cod, Ocean Perch, Pacific Cod, Halibut, Coho Salmon, Atlantic Salmon Portions, Lane Snapper, Tilapia, All Natural Salmon Fillet, Pacific Sole, and Farm Raised Striped Bass.

These items were distributed from May 2021 to October 7, 2021 to restaurants and Albertsons, Safeway, and Sprouts supermarkets in Colorado. The recalled items would have sold out of their fresh seafood cases. The Pacific Cod sold through Sprouts is not being recalled.

The recall is the result of several positive samples revealed during an FDA. inspection. FDA and CDC have informed us that these positive samples are linked to an outbreak of Salmonella illness. The production area of our facility has been temporarily shut down until such time as the FDA and the company determine that the problem has been corrected.

Consumers who have purchased raw, fresh, unpackaged seafood are urged to return the product to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Consumers with questions may call Northeast Seafood directly at 303-373-2226. Monday to Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. mountain time.

928,2021,10,29,us,Out of an Abundance of Caution Maryruth's Announces Voluntary Recall of Two Lots of ITS Liquid Probiotic for Infants Because of the Potential for Contamination with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,"MaryRuth’s, a leading omni-channel health and wellness brand that offers vitamins, minerals, and supplements for the entire family, today announced that, out of an abundance of caution, it is voluntarily recalling two lots of its liquid probiotic for infants (1oz) due to the possibility of contamination by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a microorganism found in the environment that, if ingested, can cause infection in immunocompromised individuals or, rarely, in very young infants. P. aeruginosa infections in immunocompromised infants are generally limited to hospital settings. In such settings, there is the chance that the infant’s immature gut will not be able to prevent P. aeruginosa from gaining access to the blood, and from there it can disseminate elsewhere in the body, resulting in the possibility of serious adverse health consequences. This recall only affects two lots of the product, Lot #100420218 and Lot #100520218, UPC barcode number 856645008587. Lot numbers are located on the side of the bottle and on the bottom of the outer container in which the product is sold. No other lots or any other MaryRuth’s products are affected by this recall. This product is distributed nationwide through Target, Amazon, and direct sales from the company’s website. The company is asking consumers to throw away product from both affected lot numbers. Impacted consumers may contact MaryRuth’s Customer Care Center to request a full refund, please see contact information provided below. The company discovered the potential issue with one of its manufacturing partners during routine laboratory testing, which is a part of MaryRuth’s vigorous quality assurance procedures and safety protocols, and decided to take this precautionary measure. The only product complaint the company has received with respect to the affected product lots was one report of temporary diarrhea in an older infant after consuming the product, which the company does not believe was related to the presence of the microorganism. “We apologize for any concern or inconvenience this situation causes our customers and are here to support them,” said MaryRuth’s Founder and CEO MaryRuth Ghiyam. “MaryRuth’s is dedicated to the safety, health and welfare of its customers above all else, and has invested heavily, and continues to invest, in safety and quality protocols to ensure we produce only the best products.” For more information please contact MaryRuth’s via phone 1-800-210-0813 or email support@maryruthorganics.com.

935,2021,12,15,hk,Two prepackaged date samples in breach of food labelling regulation,"Two prepackaged date samples in breach of food labelling regulation The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (December 15) that two samples of prepackaged date were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative which is allowed to be used in certain foods, but the functional class and/or name of the additive were not declared on the food labels. Members of the public should not consume the affected products. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess them. Product details are as follows: Sample (1) Product name: Chinese Date Brand: Green dot dot Place of origin: China Net weight: 350 grams Distributor: Organic Gardens International Limited (recall hotline: 3181 4488) Sample (2) Product name: (Not available in English) Brand: (Not available in English) Place of origin: China Net weight: 605g Distributor: (Not available in English) (recall hotline: 2300 1800) Best-before date: October 31, 2022 ""The CFS collected sample (1) from a department store in Hung Hom for testing when following up on an earlier relevant incident, and collected sample (2) from an online shop for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test results showed that both samples contained sulphur dioxide. Although the sulphur dioxide levels were below the maximum permitted level under the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD), the functional class and/or name of the additive were not declared on the food labels of the samples,"" a CFS spokesman said. ""The CFS has informed the vendors concerned of the irregularities, and instructed them to stop sale and remove from shelves the affected product of sample (1) and the affected batch of the product of sample (2) respectively. The above-mentioned distributors have initiated recalls according to the CFS' instructions. Members of the public may call the respective hotlines above during office hours for enquiries about the recalls. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence,"" the spokesman added. Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headache and nausea after consumption. The spokesman reminded the food trade that the use of preservatives in food must comply with the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD). Furthermore, the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require that for all prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong containing sulphite in a concentration of 10 parts per million or more, the functional class of the sulphite and its name shall be specified in the list of ingredients. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.

            WASHINGTON, Feb. 18, 2022 - Corfu Foods, Inc., a Bensenville, Ill. firm, is recalling approximately 6,570 pounds of swai (Siluriformes) fish products imported from Vietnam that were not presented for import reinspection into the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The frozen swai fish fillet items were imported on Jan. 15, 2022. The following products are subject to recall. See labels here.

15-lb. bulk corrugated box packages containing various sizes of ""PACIFIC DYNASTY SWAI FILLETS"" and lot code VN 461 VI 354.
These items were shipped to institutions, restaurants, and retail locations in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Consumers may have purchased the swai fillets in bulk or hand wrapped from the fish counter at retailers.

The problem was discovered when a company notified FSIS that they received and further distributed imported product without verifying that the product was presented for FSIS import reinspection.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional, restaurant, or consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Restaurants and institutions are urged not to serve these products. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Consumers and members of the media with questions about the recall can contact Chris Memmos, Director of Sales and Marketing, Corfu Foods, Inc., at 630-595-2510 or cm@corfufoods.com.

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, March 10, 2022 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert for a ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken salad product containing a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated salad dressing that has been recalled by the producer due to concerns that the salad dressing may contain hard plastic. FSIS is issuing this public health alert to ensure that consumers are aware that these products should not be consumed.
The chicken salad product items were produced on 3/03/22, 3/04/22, 3/05/22, and 3/06/22. The following product is subject to the public health alert [view label here]:
12-oz. plastic tray packages containing “Trader Joe’s CRUNCHY SLAW with Chicken, Crispy Noodles & Peanut Dressing” and a use by date of 03/09/22, 03/10/22, 03/11/22, or 03/12/22 printed on the label.
The products bear establishment number “P-6247” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.
The problem was discovered when an FSIS inspected establishment received notification from their salad dressing supplier that the salad dressing, which is regulated by FDA, may contain hard plastic. The establishment then notified FSIS of the issue. FSIS and FDA are coordinating on this issue.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.

The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness).  Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

            WASHINGTON, May 20, 2022 – Smithfield Packaged Meats Corp., a Sioux Center, Iowa establishment, is recalling approximately 185,610 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) bacon topping products that may be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically metal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.
FSIS expects there to be additional products containing the bacon and urges consumers to check back frequently to view updated lists and labels. 
The RTE item was produced on various dates between Feb. 21, 2022 to Feb. 23, 2022 and March 3, 2022 to March 5, 2022. The following product is subject to recall [view labels]:   
5-lb. packages containing “Golden Crisp PATRICK CUDAHY PRECOOKED BACON TOPPING” SKU 43200 12002 with lot codes 2054, 2062 and 2063.
5-lb. packages containing “Smithfield PRECOOKED BACON TOPPING” SKU 43200 12003 with lot codes 2063 and 2064.

5-lb. packages containing “MEMBER’S MARK FULLY COOKED BACON CRUMBLES” SKU 78742240923 with “BEST IF USED BY” date of “2022-11-18.”
The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 27384” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations nationwide. Some of the bacon product may have been used to produce other products.
The problem was discovered after the firm received a customer complaint reporting they found metal in the RTE bacon topping product.
There have been no confirmed reports of injuries or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.
FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or found at distributor and retail locations. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. Additionally, distributors and retailers are urged not to sell these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness).  Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

  FSIS Announcement
  
  
  
            WASHINGTON, July 7, 2022 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert for rendered pork fat products that were produced without the benefit of federal inspection. A recall was not requested because the products are no longer available for purchase.

The rendered pork fat items were produced on various dates from Nov. 26, 2021, to April 29, 2022. The following products are subject to the public health alert [view labels]:

1.8-lb. plastic containers of ""MANTECA RENDERED PORK FAT DON PANCHITO""
The products bear establishment number ""EST. 19900"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to a warehouse distributor in Bronx, New York.

FSIS was notified by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets that the rendered pork fat products were produced and shipped into commerce without the benefit of FSIS inspection. These products are misbranded due to the unauthorized use of the marks of federal inspection.

There have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness or reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' refrigerators or pantries. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Consumers and members of the media with questions about the recall can contact Mr. Francisco Flores, President of Don Panchito Deli & Grocery Corp at 212-828-9097.

Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.

Among the adult male population who are most likely to use these products, adult males who use nitrates for cardiac conditions are at the most at risk from these products.
