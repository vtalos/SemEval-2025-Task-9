    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses the [**Food Hazard Detection** task from SemEval 2025](https://food-hazard-detection-semeval-2025.github.io/), which involves identifying food-related hazards and affected products from food-incident reports collected from the web. The goal is to classify incidents based on textual descriptions, aiding in food safety monitoring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this problem, we fine-tuned **BERT-based transformer models**, including **BERT-mini** and **DistilBERT**, on the provided dataset. We tokenized the text using the BERT tokenizer, and trained the model using a weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach includes early stopping based on validation loss, a learning rate scheduler, and mixed-precision training for efficiency. Finally, we evaluated performance using macro-F1 scores and generated predictions for both the validation and test set."
